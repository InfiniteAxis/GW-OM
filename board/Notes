&GHint &C#1: &WI had a fascination with various anime songs, especially from 
series such as Tenchi Muyo, Trigun, and various Gundam series

game due to my name. &C(Obviously not the one I've been logging in with since

&GHint &C#3: &WI was part of a IC family.

Subject &GThe &PReveal &GGame &B- &YThe &RFinal &CHint~
Text
&WWell, here we are, the Final Hint.&/
This is the hint that I personally think that is the biggest one. Aramaust 
seemed to agree as well when I ran these hints past him.&/
Soon, my anonymity will be gone. Chances are, if this hint isn't obvious,
chances are that you are from after I'd gone inactive. That or you were not
paying attention.&/
 
&GHint &C#6:&W I had an Alt Character that ran a &RPawn Shop&W, where I bought and sold
just about any item that came in my direction. Even from time to time to be
the Delivery-girl between two players.&/
If I recall, after I had gone inactive, someone took up the space I had left
in the Pawn Shop market. Don't recall who though.&/
 
Do note, I'll accept the names of my Main, my Pawn Shop Alt, or my Immortal 
name... Pretty sure I remember my old Imm name anyways. I'm sure if someone 
gave the right one for that name I'd recognize it :P&/
Wait.. Whats this?
&RB&rO&RN&rU&RS &rH&RI&rN&RT&G!&/
&WThats right! An extra bonus hint! It really isn't that much of a hint,
but here it is:&/
&YI used to often hit people with a hammer.&/
 
&/&/&/&G- &WM&zou&Ps&ze&/
&YP.S. I'll probably be requesting a name change after this is all over with. 
&YSince &Yapparently my chosen name is conflicting with a single Mob called 
Mighty Mouse.
&YGo figure eh?

Subject &GThe &PReveal &GGame - &PR&pe&Pv&pe&Pa&pl&Pe&pd~
Text
Well, here we are, the end of the game. I am honestly surprised that no one got the answer. So it appears the following is the case.&/
&G1.&W A lot of people are from after my mainstay
&G2.&W I was not as well known as Aramaust and I thought.
&G3.&W Some people were not paying attention (Agar :P)&/
Oh well this makes for new impressions on people I suppose.&/
So the answer? I am Sora, the younger IC sister of Lokita and Rinoa. 
My love for certain Trigun songs resulted in me making an Alternate
character named Rem, who ran that Pawn Shop. (Even created a AIM
username for kicks just for that character.)
Back when I was an Immortal, my IMM name, if I recall correctly, 
was Rena. I was just a lowly Player Interactions Immortal.
Fun note: Becoming an Immortal is actually what had originally started
my decline from playing the MUD. It.. Ruined the experience I suppose.&/
So that brings up a note or two. &/
For the most part, since it has been 7+ years since I've seen a number
of you, and never for the rest. 
To the Oldbies, for the most part, I'm starting interactions fresh.
Those that I remember may no longer apply since it has been a long
time, and people can change. Though this does not stop me getting the
old impressions back for doing the same things now as you used to do.&/
So this basically means everyone got a new start when I rejoined to
make impressions upon your personalities.&/
To the New Timers, hello there. :D&/
So that's basically it.&/
Oh, and I don't quite know why, its probably just my faulty memory.
But I seem to recall there being a second Sora that showed up after I
had originally went into hiatus, after my character got deleted.&/
If I recall also.. they were a guy.. ugh...&/
I'm the one from Alaska.&/
&/&/&/&G- &WM&zou&Ps&ze&w,&W once known as Sora.&/
&YP.S. Oh Gunther, I'm ready for that name change.&/

Subject Stat Soft/Hard Cap~
Text
I've noticed that a few of my stats do not go over a certain number no matter what I wear or what skills I use. This is normal. What I suggest is that the stat hard cap be changed to allow them to increase no matter what, up to say 35 at max.
 
I've heard many people, not from here, that tell me it can't be done. I know for a fact that it can be. 
 
There would be the racial max, (soft cap), that you couldn't go above, (even with training if it gets put back in), and then the max possible it could go, (Hard cap of 35 as per my example), with equipment and skills.
 
If I could get in touch with the guy that coded it on an old mud I built on I would but I haven't been able to for a few months now.

Subject Logo for O:M~
Text
So as many people know by now, I've been working on a small art project
these past few days. Centered around a 'Logo' for Operation: Meteor.
For the most part, its finished, or atleast far enough that I have
posted it on my dA. &/
http://callmesora.deviantart.com/art/Operation-Meteor-309496700 &/
So there it is. I was thinking of suggesting it to Gunther and others,
as a place holder image for the front page of the offical site.
&/One thing I probably should mention since it might be brought up.
I did suggest a few MUDs in the description, but do note, it was
directed at people who may have never MUDed ever before. And honestly,
I don't see this MUD being the best environment for someone THAT new to
MUDs.&/
So please forgive me if that breaks a Anti-Advert rule. I just rather
not scare away new MUDers away from the genre by some of the things that
some of us here say.
&/I'd like them to learn to MUD, then join up, especially after the
planned revamping that all the Coders are working on right now.
I'm all for getting more members on here. I'd love to see the MUD get
a second silver, or even golden age.

Subject Heyo-!~
Text
Decided to come check on things after being gone for so long.
looks like there has been little activity on the note boards,
so I dont know how active things have been lately.
 
I've been busy as of late, and havn't really thought of
anything to really do in the MUD. Hense why I havn't been on
here in a good while.
 
I'll probably pop in from time to time to check on things.
It'd probably also be nice to know what has been going on, 
changes wise to the game
 
So what has been going on for everyone who still comes
around to these parts?
