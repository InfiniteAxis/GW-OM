Everyone please make a note that around noon Eastern Time on Saturday June 16th we will no longer be running the mud on the Xidus server
Everything will still be the same on the new server with your characters so please do not worry about that.
We are making this change due to the amount of lag we continue to get off the current server.
The new address will be &Ygundamom.net &zwith port number staying the same as currently &Y1984&z
Thank to everyone for you understanding.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Text
Everyone please make a note that around noon Eastern Time on Saturday June 16th we will no longer be running the mud on the Xidus server
Everything will still be the same on the new server with your characters so please do not worry about that.
We are making this change due to the amount of lag we continue to get off the current server.
The new address will be &Ygundamom.net &zwith port number staying the same as currently &Y1984&z
Thank to everyone for you understanding.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Looking for a way to earn "bonus points?"
 
Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Looking for a way to earn "bonus points?"
 
Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,
and depth!  The better the character background is while
still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships
with characters from the series), the more tokens you
will be awarded!
That is all, as you were.

Everyone please make a note that around noon Eastern Time on Saturday June 16th we will no longer be running the mud on the Xidus server
Everything will still be the same on the new server with your characters so please do not worry about that.
We are making this change due to the amount of lag we continue to get off the current server.
The new address will be &Ygundamom.net &zwith port number staying the same as currently &Y1984&z

you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Looking for a way to earn "bonus points?"
 
Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,
and depth!  The better the character background is while
still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships
with characters from the series), the more tokens you
will be awarded!
That is all, as you were.

Everyone please make a note that around noon Eastern Time on Saturday June 16th we will no longer be running the mud on the Xidus server

Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Everyone please make a note that around noon Eastern Time on Saturday June 16th we will no longer be running the mud on the Xidus server
Everything will still be the same on the new server with your characters so please do not worry about that.
We are making this change due to the amount of lag we continue to get off the current server.
The new address will be &Ygundamom.net &zwith port number staying the same as currently &Y1984&z
Thank to everyone for you understanding.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

You can see him for hunting down objects and peices of shit that need
killing for whatever they did to piss Duo off in the first place!
 
What's this get you, you ask? Favor points, which you can trade for

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Looking for a way to earn "bonus points?"
 
Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,
and depth!  The better the character background is while
still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships

will be awarded!
That is all, as you were.

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.
EBD

Subject Character backgrounds~
Text
Looking for a way to earn "bonus points?"
 
Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,
and depth!  The better the character background is while
still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships
with characters from the series), the more tokens you
will be awarded!
That is all, as you were.

Everyone please make a note that around noon Eastern Time on Saturday June 16th we will no longer be running the mud on the Xidus server
Everything will still be the same on the new server with your characters so please do not worry about that.
We are making this change due to the amount of lag we continue to get off the current server.
The new address will be &Ygundamom.net &zwith port number staying the same as currently &Y1984&z

Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,
and depth!  The better the character background is while
still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships
with characters from the series), the more tokens you
will be awarded!
That is all, as you were.

Everyone please make a note that around noon Eastern Time on Saturday June 16th we will no longer be running the mud on the Xidus server
Everything will still be the same on the new server with your characters so please do not worry about that.
We are making this change due to the amount of lag we continue to get off the current server.
The new address will be &Ygundamom.net &zwith port number staying the same as currently &Y1984&z

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Subject Server Change~
Text
Everyone please make a note that around noon Eastern Time on Saturday June 16th we will no longer be running the mud on the Xidus server
Everything will still be the same on the new server with your characters so please do not worry about that.
We are making this change due to the amount of lag we continue to get off the current server.
The new address will be &Ygundamom.net &zwith port number staying the same as currently &Y1984&z
Thank to everyone for you understanding.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Looking for a way to earn "bonus points?"
 
Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,
and depth!  The better the character background is while
still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships

will be awarded!
That is all, as you were.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.
EBD

Looking for a way to earn "bonus points?"
 
Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,

still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Hey again,
 
So apparently there was a small glitch where prop and mass
prop would succeed, but stop short of the exp gain. Those
issues have been corrected. So spam to your hearts content

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Write a background for your character!

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Hey again,
 
So apparently there was a small glitch where prop and mass

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.
EBD

Looking for a way to earn "bonus points?"
 
Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,

still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's

an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

You can see him for hunting down objects and peices of shit that need

What's this get you, you ask? Favor points, which you can trade for

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

You can see him for hunting down objects and peices of shit that need

What's this get you, you ask? Favor points, which you can trade for

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

You can see him for hunting down objects and peices of shit that need

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Everything will still be the same on the new server with your characters so please do not worry about that.
We are making this change due to the amount of lag we continue to get off the current server.
The new address will be &Ygundamom.net &zwith port number staying the same as currently &Y1984&z
Thank to everyone for you understanding.

You can see him for hunting down objects and peices of shit that need
killing for whatever they did to piss Duo off in the first place!
 
What's this get you, you ask? Favor points, which you can trade for

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Everyone please make a note that around noon Eastern Time on Saturday June 16th we will no longer be running the mud on the Xidus server
Everything will still be the same on the new server with your characters so please do not worry about that.
We are making this change due to the amount of lag we continue to get off the current server.
The new address will be &Ygundamom.net &zwith port number staying the same as currently &Y1984&z
Thank to everyone for you understanding.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Hey all,

content. That works for ideas, mistakes, etc. as well.
 
 
For the immortals of 1007, destroy works again. So have

Everyone please make a note that around noon Eastern Time on Saturday June 16th we will no longer be running the mud on the Xidus server
Everything will still be the same on the new server with your characters so please do not worry about that.
We are making this change due to the amount of lag we continue to get off the current server.
The new address will be &Ygundamom.net &zwith port number staying the same as currently &Y1984&z
Thank to everyone for you understanding.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

For the immortals of 1007, destroy works again. So have

Everyone please make a note that around noon Eastern Time on Saturday June 16th we will no longer be running the mud on the Xidus server
Everything will still be the same on the new server with your characters so please do not worry about that.
We are making this change due to the amount of lag we continue to get off the current server.
The new address will be &Ygundamom.net &zwith port number staying the same as currently &Y1984&z
Thank to everyone for you understanding.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Hey all,
 
Notes now work again, they'll save and load to your hearts
content. That works for ideas, mistakes, etc. as well.
 
 
For the immortals of 1007, destroy works again. So have
fun torturing bitchy players :P
 
 
Anyways, that's all for now.

Text
Everyone please make a note that around noon Eastern Time on Saturday June 16th we will no longer be running the mud on the Xidus server
Everything will still be the same on the new server with your characters so please do not worry about that.
We are making this change due to the amount of lag we continue to get off the current server.
The new address will be &Ygundamom.net &zwith port number staying the same as currently &Y1984&z
Thank to everyone for you understanding.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor

character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

I'm not dead yet!
I've been on vacation since the 4th of June and have been
checking in every once in a while to see who's on and if
I've missed anything. Seems like nobody's on when I am and
I haven't missed anything.  I'll be home late on the 24th.
Hopefully you'll all show back up when I get back. :P

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Write a background for your character!

integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,

Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,
and depth!  The better the character background is while
still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships
with characters from the series), the more tokens you
will be awarded!
That is all, as you were.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Looking for a way to earn "bonus points?"
 
Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,
and depth!  The better the character background is while
still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships
with characters from the series), the more tokens you
will be awarded!
That is all, as you were.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for

Looking for a way to earn "bonus points?"
 
Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,

Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.
EBD

Subject Character backgrounds~
Text
Looking for a way to earn "bonus points?"
 
Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,
and depth!  The better the character background is while
still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships
with characters from the series), the more tokens you
will be awarded!
That is all, as you were.

Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.
EBD

Text
Looking for a way to earn "bonus points?"
 
Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,
and depth!  The better the character background is while
still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships
with characters from the series), the more tokens you
will be awarded!
That is all, as you were.

Greetings!

First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.
EBD

Looking for a way to earn "bonus points?"
 
Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,
and depth!  The better the character background is while
still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships
with characters from the series), the more tokens you
will be awarded!
That is all, as you were.

Greetings!

First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.
EBD

Looking for a way to earn "bonus points?"
 
Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,
and depth!  The better the character background is while
still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships

will be awarded!
That is all, as you were.

First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.

First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.
EBD

Subject Character backgrounds~
Text
Looking for a way to earn "bonus points?"
 
Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,
and depth!  The better the character background is while
still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships
with characters from the series), the more tokens you
will be awarded!
That is all, as you were.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Looking for a way to earn "bonus points?"
 
Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,

still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.
EBD

Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,

So apparently there was a small glitch where prop and mass
prop would succeed, but stop short of the exp gain. Those
issues have been corrected. So spam to your hearts content
on two of the best ways to gain diplo exp :P

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Whatup!?
 
Back again briefly to inform you all that our dear friend, and 
task master Duo Maxwell, is back in business!
 
You can see him for hunting down objects and peices of shit that need
killing for whatever they did to piss Duo off in the first place!
 
What's this get you, you ask? Favor points, which you can trade for
sweet equipment if I recall.
 
 
So locate the Task Master on Rommefellar, and have fun :P

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Write a background for your character!

You can see him for hunting down objects and peices of shit that need

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

You can see him for hunting down objects and peices of shit that need
killing for whatever they did to piss Duo off in the first place!
 
What's this get you, you ask? Favor points, which you can trade for

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Everyone please make a note that around noon Eastern Time on Saturday June 16th we will no longer be running the mud on the Xidus server
Everything will still be the same on the new server with your characters so please do not worry about that.
We are making this change due to the amount of lag we continue to get off the current server.
The new address will be &Ygundamom.net &zwith port number staying the same as currently &Y1984&z
Thank to everyone for you understanding.

Whatup!?
 
Back again briefly to inform you all that our dear friend, and 
task master Duo Maxwell, is back in business!
 
You can see him for hunting down objects and peices of shit that need
killing for whatever they did to piss Duo off in the first place!
 
What's this get you, you ask? Favor points, which you can trade for
sweet equipment if I recall.
 
 
So locate the Task Master on Rommefellar, and have fun :P

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Everyone please make a note that around noon Eastern Time on Saturday June 16th we will no longer be running the mud on the Xidus server
Everything will still be the same on the new server with your characters so please do not worry about that.
We are making this change due to the amount of lag we continue to get off the current server.
The new address will be &Ygundamom.net &zwith port number staying the same as currently &Y1984&z
Thank to everyone for you understanding.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Hey all,

content. That works for ideas, mistakes, etc. as well.
 
 
For the immortals of 1007, destroy works again. So have

Everyone please make a note that around noon Eastern Time on Saturday June 16th we will no longer be running the mud on the Xidus server
Everything will still be the same on the new server with your characters so please do not worry about that.
We are making this change due to the amount of lag we continue to get off the current server.
The new address will be &Ygundamom.net &zwith port number staying the same as currently &Y1984&z
Thank to everyone for you understanding.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

For the immortals of 1007, destroy works again. So have

Everyone please make a note that around noon Eastern Time on Saturday June 16th we will no longer be running the mud on the Xidus server
Everything will still be the same on the new server with your characters so please do not worry about that.
We are making this change due to the amount of lag we continue to get off the current server.
The new address will be &Ygundamom.net &zwith port number staying the same as currently &Y1984&z
Thank to everyone for you understanding.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Hey all,
 
Notes now work again, they'll save and load to your hearts
content. That works for ideas, mistakes, etc. as well.
 
 
For the immortals of 1007, destroy works again. So have
fun torturing bitchy players :P
 
 
Anyways, that's all for now.

Text
Everyone please make a note that around noon Eastern Time on Saturday June 16th we will no longer be running the mud on the Xidus server
Everything will still be the same on the new server with your characters so please do not worry about that.
We are making this change due to the amount of lag we continue to get off the current server.
The new address will be &Ygundamom.net &zwith port number staying the same as currently &Y1984&z
Thank to everyone for you understanding.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor

character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

I'm not dead yet!
I've been on vacation since the 4th of June and have been
checking in every once in a while to see who's on and if
I've missed anything. Seems like nobody's on when I am and
I haven't missed anything.  I'll be home late on the 24th.
Hopefully you'll all show back up when I get back. :P

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Write a background for your character!

integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,

Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,
and depth!  The better the character background is while
still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships
with characters from the series), the more tokens you
will be awarded!
That is all, as you were.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

Looking for a way to earn "bonus points?"
 
Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,
and depth!  The better the character background is while
still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships
with characters from the series), the more tokens you
will be awarded!
That is all, as you were.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.

would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability

Text
Looking for a way to earn "bonus points?"
 
Write a background for your character!
 
Just type "bio" and it will bring you to a text editor
and you will be able to write a back story for your
character, which will earn you bonus points for creativity,
integration with the Gundam time line(s), creativity,
and depth!  The better the character background is while
still keeping it "honest" (not creating false relationships
with characters from the series), the more tokens you
will be awarded!
That is all, as you were.

Everyone please make a note that around noon Eastern Time on Saturday June 16th we will no longer be running the mud on the Xidus server
Everything will still be the same on the new server with your characters so please do not worry about that.
We are making this change due to the amount of lag we continue to get off the current server.
The new address will be &Ygundamom.net &zwith port number staying the same as currently &Y1984&z
Thank to everyone for you understanding.

Subject OOC vs. IC~
Text
Greetings!
save
 
First off, I'm glad to see that you guys are talking about
doing things in groups and are trying to organize it amongst
yourselves. Flippin' amazing.
 
I do have one SLIGHT issue with the way you're doing it though.
You guys seem to be using OOC for conversations that "shouldn't"
be had on that channel. I just read the scrollback and it was
about killing Claude and Odin, skills, and killing NPCs.
That stuff is meant to be on IC rather than OOC.  Now, I could
punish everyone involved in that conversation, but that wouldn't
seem to be that well of a thought out plan on my part; so instead
I decided to write this and let you guys know that there's
an In Character channel for stuff IC, and an Out Of Character
channel for stuff that's OOC.  I can understand the occasional
mischan (xchan, or whatever you want to call it), but please
try to keep the channels straight.
 
Thanks. :D

Subject Channel histories~
Text
Greetings to all!
 
We have this wonderful system for channels implemented in this code base,
(relax, this is not another one of my lecture notes on proper channel usage)
and I am here to tell you about one of the features that it offers that
you may  not know about.  The feature is the ability to recall the last
few things said on some of the public channels by simply typing the channel
you would like a history of.  That feature is called (wait for it)
channel histories.  Say for example that you ask someone something on a
public channel and they didn't respond because they were afk and now
they're back.  Rather than reasking your question, if you let them know you
would like an answer to the question you asked, they now have the ability 
to type the channel name (ie: ooc or ic, music, etc) to see what has been
said and also your question, to which they can now respond.  This works for
most public channels, but does not work on private channels (say and tell)
at this time; I'll mention adding tell to the system to Arcturis when I next
speak to him, but for now you'll have to scroll back to see tells that you've missed.
