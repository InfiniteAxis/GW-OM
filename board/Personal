Subject helpfiles~
Text
Since you're more interested in getting the helpfiles fixed
than you are having areas fixed/built, when I can (maybe Monday
or maybe not until I get unpacked after I move next weekend),
I'll start at the top of the commands list and check/make
the helpfile for every command and make sure that there
either is one or that the one that there is for the command
save
is correct.  It's going to take a while though, so please
don't harp on me about how it's going.  I'll let you know
when it's done.

Hello Cray.
&/I wanted to get this over and done with. I recently found logs of the
last time we interacted. And I want to apologize for how I acted back
when we last talked, genuinely this time. Not the same "I'm sorry" I 
gave you last time.
&/The last time we spoke, way back in 2005, I was a general bitch, and
honestly, there was no excuse for how I acted.
&/We've both done stupid things. It also has been 7+ years, people
change, you have, and so have I. We're no longer the same people we
were then. I had recently decided that I would start relations anew,
throwing out what I knew of people, and let them make a new
impression. This includes you.
&/So if we start hating each other, let it be over new stuff, and not
the old stuff.
&/&/&/&G- &WM&zou&Ps&ze &GAKA&W Sora/Rem/Rena
&YP.S. By the time you read this, I might have gotten my name changed
&Yby Gunther to something that doesn't conflict with the Mighty Mouse mob.

Obviously do what you gotta to clan system to make It look the old way.
1. Tasks are not working prolly just something simple but I would like them in.
2. You already started to look into pcrename.
3. I dunno if you can/want to finish up the train system. I dont think Ghost will ever do it.
4. Adding PPK back in and I the benefits of doing such ie. Armor doesnt get damaged in ppk but does in pk.
I think that is all I have for now but when I think of any more I will let you know.
Thanks a lot man for helping out. I was starting to get frustrated that Ghost wasnt getting any where with fixes.
 
Thanks
Gunther

Hey man,
 
I messed around with it for a while, but I couldn't get it
to start, I'm shit with that kind of stuff.
 
However Ghost did have a copy running on port 1987,
so he definitely knows how to get past the boot error.
 
Hopefully he can fix that for us, cause that shell
is way frickin quicker Lol

Hey man something happened with score/level. The amount of exp need for next level keeps growing into huge numbers.
I dont know wtf is going on. If I could get you to code for me a couple days a week I would get rid of the other coder and keep Ghost.
Anyways with ppk it needs made so ppk does not get damaged equipment and I believe that is all because I think owning a gundam and entering a gang
should stay as an incentive to go pk. You have been a huge help, I cant thank you enough. Any questions please ask.
 
Thanks

I need something taken care of.
Frost and Phoenix on m9, 
Players can steal their items in the invontory being the ice shard armor,
THe burning mask of phoenix, the nightmare and nemesis.
I need it changed so rather when somebody tries to steal the items the mob
attacks them automatically and the player has no chance of getting the item. 
Or take the items out of their inventory and make it a program alot like the bounty heads
are.
Either way i dont care how you do it. I just need it changed so the items can't be 
stolen.
The mobs needs to be killed in order to get the items.
Thats what i have in mind right now.

Subject Being Targetted buy Ships non stop~

I went to System X and did a little piloting training. When I was done I started flying away. I went to R28 and landed. The entire time I got the message, "Your suit is being targeted by Peacemillion." and "Your suit is being targeted by Virgo V24."
 
This persisted even when landed and even after exiting the ship.

Yeah I lost essenetially everything due to being unable to retrieve my corpse. Anything would be of great assistance. It sucks because I was doing a quest and the merc was a bit beastier than expected. Lost a Full Set of Gear, 2 Full Jewels, half a jewel
and enough shards to complete a Jewel. The only fortunate aspect of this ordeal is I hadn't bought my Task Gear yet lol  I work 3-11PM EST and am available most others times. When would be good for you?
