I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

Makeblaster doesn't work.  I mean, code wise it's probably fine.
But, there aren't any furnace type items in the game and
when I tried to make one I got &pUnknown type: furnace&T.

Subject Alloy Upgrade Mistake~
Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

I purchased Z-Gundanium Alloy for Epyon, which was applied successfully,
but i looked at it last night and now its equipped with Gundanium Alloy,
somthing i DID NOT buy or switch to. Can you look into this matter and find
out what happened? I'd rather not waste another 4.5mil rebuying an armor if
it was a bug and could possibly happen again.

Makeblaster doesn't work.  I mean, code wise it's probably fine.
But, there aren't any furnace type items in the game and
when I tried to make one I got &pUnknown type: furnace&T.

Subject Alloy Upgrade Mistake~
Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

I purchased Z-Gundanium Alloy for Epyon, which was applied successfully,
but i looked at it last night and now its equipped with Gundanium Alloy,
somthing i DID NOT buy or switch to. Can you look into this matter and find
out what happened? I'd rather not waste another 4.5mil rebuying an armor if
it was a bug and could possibly happen again.

Makeblaster doesn't work.  I mean, code wise it's probably fine.
But, there aren't any furnace type items in the game and
when I tried to make one I got &pUnknown type: furnace&T.

Subject Alloy Upgrade Mistake~
Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

I purchased Z-Gundanium Alloy for Epyon, which was applied successfully,
but i looked at it last night and now its equipped with Gundanium Alloy,
somthing i DID NOT buy or switch to. Can you look into this matter and find

it was a bug and could possibly happen again.

Makeblaster doesn't work.  I mean, code wise it's probably fine.
But, there aren't any furnace type items in the game and
when I tried to make one I got &pUnknown type: furnace&T.

Subject Alloy Upgrade Mistake~
Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

Makeblaster doesn't work.  I mean, code wise it's probably fine.
But, there aren't any furnace type items in the game and
when I tried to make one I got &pUnknown type: furnace&T.

Subject Alloy Upgrade Mistake~
Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

She doesnt sell armor like shes supposed to. Missing resets,

Makeblaster doesn't work.  I mean, code wise it's probably fine.
But, there aren't any furnace type items in the game and
when I tried to make one I got &pUnknown type: furnace&T.

Subject Alloy Upgrade Mistake~
Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

somthing i DID NOT buy or switch to. Can you look into this matter and find
out what happened? I'd rather not waste another 4.5mil rebuying an armor if
it was a bug and could possibly happen again.
 
Thanks in advance

She doesnt sell armor like shes supposed to. Missing resets,

Makeblaster doesn't work.  I mean, code wise it's probably fine.
But, there aren't any furnace type items in the game and
when I tried to make one I got &pUnknown type: furnace&T.

Subject Alloy Upgrade Mistake~
Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

I purchased Z-Gundanium Alloy for Epyon, which was applied successfully,
but i looked at it last night and now its equipped with Gundanium Alloy,
somthing i DID NOT buy or switch to. Can you look into this matter and find
out what happened? I'd rather not waste another 4.5mil rebuying an armor if
it was a bug and could possibly happen again.
 
Thanks in advance

She doesnt sell armor like shes supposed to. Missing resets,

Makeblaster doesn't work.  I mean, code wise it's probably fine.
But, there aren't any furnace type items in the game and
when I tried to make one I got &pUnknown type: furnace&T.

Subject Alloy Upgrade Mistake~
Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

I purchased Z-Gundanium Alloy for Epyon, which was applied successfully,
but i looked at it last night and now its equipped with Gundanium Alloy,
somthing i DID NOT buy or switch to. Can you look into this matter and find
out what happened? I'd rather not waste another 4.5mil rebuying an armor if
it was a bug and could possibly happen again.
 
Thanks in advance

She doesnt sell armor like shes supposed to. Missing resets,

make her a full shop. I dunno the reason but i do know i want

Makeblaster doesn't work.  I mean, code wise it's probably fine.
But, there aren't any furnace type items in the game and
when I tried to make one I got &pUnknown type: furnace&T.

Subject Alloy Upgrade Mistake~
Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

I purchased Z-Gundanium Alloy for Epyon, which was applied successfully,
but i looked at it last night and now its equipped with Gundanium Alloy,
somthing i DID NOT buy or switch to. Can you look into this matter and find
out what happened? I'd rather not waste another 4.5mil rebuying an armor if
it was a bug and could possibly happen again.
 
Thanks in advance

Subject Alloy Upgrade Mistake~
Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

Subject Alloy Upgrade Mistake~
Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

I purchased Z-Gundanium Alloy for Epyon, which was applied successfully,
but i looked at it last night and now its equipped with Gundanium Alloy,
somthing i DID NOT buy or switch to. Can you look into this matter and find
out what happened? I'd rather not waste another 4.5mil rebuying an armor if
it was a bug and could possibly happen again.
 
Thanks in advance

You cannot stalk players with names of mobs on the grid. Meaning Zero and Scorpion are not stalkable.

Subject Alloy Upgrade Mistake~
Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

I purchased Z-Gundanium Alloy for Epyon, which was applied successfully,
but i looked at it last night and now its equipped with Gundanium Alloy,
somthing i DID NOT buy or switch to. Can you look into this matter and find
out what happened? I'd rather not waste another 4.5mil rebuying an armor if
it was a bug and could possibly happen again.
 
Thanks in advance

You cannot stalk players with names of mobs on the grid. Meaning Zero and Scorpion are not stalkable.

Subject Alloy Upgrade Mistake~
Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

I purchased Z-Gundanium Alloy for Epyon, which was applied successfully,
but i looked at it last night and now its equipped with Gundanium Alloy,
somthing i DID NOT buy or switch to. Can you look into this matter and find
out what happened? I'd rather not waste another 4.5mil rebuying an armor if
it was a bug and could possibly happen again.

You cannot stalk players with names of mobs on the grid. Meaning Zero and Scorpion are not stalkable.
This is a bug, and is being abused knowingly by at least Scorpion, im unsure if zero knew.

Makeblaster doesn't work.  I mean, code wise it's probably fine.

Subject Alloy Upgrade Mistake~
Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

I purchased Z-Gundanium Alloy for Epyon, which was applied successfully,
but i looked at it last night and now its equipped with Gundanium Alloy,
somthing i DID NOT buy or switch to. Can you look into this matter and find
out what happened? I'd rather not waste another 4.5mil rebuying an armor if
it was a bug and could possibly happen again.

You cannot stalk players with names of mobs on the grid. Meaning Zero and Scorpion are not stalkable.
This is a bug, and is being abused knowingly by at least Scorpion, im unsure if zero knew.

Makeblaster doesn't work.  I mean, code wise it's probably fine.

Subject Alloy Upgrade Mistake~
Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

I purchased Z-Gundanium Alloy for Epyon, which was applied successfully,
but i looked at it last night and now its equipped with Gundanium Alloy,
somthing i DID NOT buy or switch to. Can you look into this matter and find
out what happened? I'd rather not waste another 4.5mil rebuying an armor if
it was a bug and could possibly happen again.

You cannot stalk players with names of mobs on the grid. Meaning Zero and Scorpion are not stalkable.
This is a bug, and is being abused knowingly by at least Scorpion, im unsure if zero knew.

Makeblaster doesn't work.  I mean, code wise it's probably fine.

Subject Alloy Upgrade Mistake~
Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

I purchased Z-Gundanium Alloy for Epyon, which was applied successfully,
but i looked at it last night and now its equipped with Gundanium Alloy,
somthing i DID NOT buy or switch to. Can you look into this matter and find
out what happened? I'd rather not waste another 4.5mil rebuying an armor if
it was a bug and could possibly happen again.

You cannot stalk players with names of mobs on the grid. Meaning Zero and Scorpion are not stalkable.
This is a bug, and is being abused knowingly by at least Scorpion, im unsure if zero knew.

Makeblaster doesn't work.  I mean, code wise it's probably fine.

Subject Alloy Upgrade Mistake~
Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

I purchased Z-Gundanium Alloy for Epyon, which was applied successfully,
but i looked at it last night and now its equipped with Gundanium Alloy,
somthing i DID NOT buy or switch to. Can you look into this matter and find
out what happened? I'd rather not waste another 4.5mil rebuying an armor if
it was a bug and could possibly happen again.

You cannot stalk players with names of mobs on the grid. Meaning Zero and Scorpion are not stalkable.
This is a bug, and is being abused knowingly by at least Scorpion, im unsure if zero knew.

Makeblaster doesn't work.  I mean, code wise it's probably fine.

Subject Alloy Upgrade Mistake~
Text
I upgraded the Epyon alloy from Gundanium to Z-Gundanium and got this message:
 
You give 500,000 dollars to the worker. (needs to be changed to 4,500,000)
Several works quickly go to work, unbolting your old armor casing, and just as fast apply your new Z-Gundanium Alloy!
 
My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

My cash on hand went from [Money] 9,766,235 to [Money] 5,266,235. As it should seeing as Z-Gundanium is 4,500,000.

I purchased Z-Gundanium Alloy for Epyon, which was applied successfully,
but i looked at it last night and now its equipped with Gundanium Alloy,
somthing i DID NOT buy or switch to. Can you look into this matter and find
out what happened? I'd rather not waste another 4.5mil rebuying an armor if
it was a bug and could possibly happen again.
 
Thanks in advance

You cannot stalk players with names of mobs on the grid. Meaning Zero and Scorpion are not stalkable.
This is a bug, and is being abused knowingly by at least Scorpion, im unsure if zero knew.

Makeblaster doesn't work.  I mean, code wise it's probably fine.
