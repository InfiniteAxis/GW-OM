Subject Leadership Skills (Guards)~
Text
Currently you have to be a member of an organization before you can call any guards of any kind. So what would someone who chose not to join an organization do? They aren't allowed to hire guards? Why not make an organization neutral guard?
A rent-a-cop if you will.Have them be called Mercenaries or Hired Guns or something. That way, when organizations are finally open, people who choose not to join an organization can still call for protection.
Cause lets face it. If your not in an organization your going to need as much help as you can get.

Subject Nicknaming Containers~
Text
This would mostly be used for bags. You could nickname <container> (Nickname) and that container would get a "Nickname" Tag after it.
So you may have 5 bags but one would be bag "consumables" or bag "weapons" and you could use all the normal commands (hold, drop, get, put ect.) with the nickname instead of the bags actual name.

Engineering has a skill that allows the players to make their own
containers and also to pick a name for the containers using
as many or as few color codes as they want.  If you make
your own containers, you can give them whatever names
you want.

Subject Prototype Suits~
Text
This was an idea that sprung from something Agar said earlier
So he is somewhat responcible for this
&/(=OOC) Agar: I think there should be a suit like this in every class.
&/He had bought the 2 Million Dollar Leo (Leo X25).
It apparently, from what he has said, has super stats.
&/(=OOC=) Agar: z gundanium alloy, 5k armor, great weaps, transform mod, great speed.&/
Then it dawned to me, the logical reason as to why a mobile suit
would have that kind of stats, would be if it were a Prototype
Much like the Tallgeese was a Prototype for all Mobile Suits.
&/From this standpoint, Leo X25 would be the upgraded Original Prototype
of the Leo series.
It was the successful attempt at scaling down the Tallgeese.
And since it was not a mass produced model, it would have
better stats.
&/So that leaves the question, what about the other series?
&/Wheres the Prototype Serpent and Taurus?
&/I would like to suggest, that the Prototypes of the other series.
Along with giving the Prototypes the model number of *00.
I would also recommend renaming X25 to X00, and create a new X25
to fill its space.
&/Each prototype would cost the same, and would be buyable by
Non-PK players, like any other non-Gundam suit.

Subject Player Home - Defaults upgrade~
Text
I recently bought an apartment, but after buying I went
"wait... whats the point?"&/
Well, the reason why I thought this is, theres not much use to homes beyond 'chilling' inside. Don't get me wrong, I like being able to just
go into a nice secluded place when I'm not doing much.&/
But, even though its your own, you can't use it as a place to 'Quit', and
still have to go to a hotel to do that. That doesn't make sense.
The only way to get a home be like that is to use 125 Tokens.&/
Sure, usually a hotel isn't that far from an apartment/home, but it is
still somewhat of an annoyance from a logic standpoint.&/
So that leaves me to suggest the first default addition for homes. The
ability to logout while in an apartment, as if you were in a hotel.&/&/
The second suggestion I have, is dropped items save over boots.
If I recall correctly, you could drop items in your home, and they'd stay
there, unless there was a server reboot/crash. &/
What I suggest is that items dropped inside a room get saved. But there is
a limit. Obviously, you would not want people to just fill their room up
worse than people do in Skyrim. &/
So I propose a limit of 2 to 5 items. These items can also be containers
to hold additional items inside. Effectively, creating things like
dressers and chests.&/
And that, leads to an idea which can do both above: Furniture stores.&/
With furniture stores, you can buy various things to 'upgrade' your
apartment/home with additional options.&/
Beds could make it so you can use an apartment as a hotel.&/
Various Bathroom pieces can make a makeshift hospital effect.&/
A computer to manage your bank money.&/
And various container items:&/
Like a fridge to store and keep fresh food.&/
And things like Chests, Dressers, and Closets for other item storage.&/
You would be allocate x-number of Home points that you can distribute to
placed furniture. Like you can have a Bed, a shower, a sink, a computer
and two chests, but not anything more than that. &/
Some people might just allocate all the points to just storage, which to
which I would recommend allowing like, a max of three container
furniture pieces.&/
Obviously, any items put into those storage furniture will be saved over
reboots, and hopefully crashes. &/

Thought it might be a nice idea to be able to tell what layer an item is. This wouldn't have to be a basic numbered layer but maybe something added after a description, (not the actual description but scripted to show after).
 
Something like form fitting, loose fit, slightly baggy, extremely baggy... If the numbered version isn't preferred.

Instead of having all the public suits just sitting around, why not make a command at all the landing pads, (rent), where when you type it 1 public suit is rolled out and you can use it. When you land that suit and leave it gets sent back into holding.
 
This one does two things. Clear up the landing pads a bit and make it so you're never without a way off a location if you really don't want to wait for the Star Shuttle.

Subject Canteen Fill Quantity Messages~
Text
I've noticed that the descriptions of how full a canteen is might be a bit lacking.
 
Currently when you fill it then look in it you get: "It's more than full of a creamy liquid." And when its one "drink" left and you look in it you get something like: "It is less then full of a creamy liquid."
 
Isn't his extremely vague?
 
"Less then full" could mean anything from taken one sip to one sip left. How about a little more clarity? Perhaps something like:
 
Full: The canteen is full of {liquid}
Full - 3/4: The canteen is almost full
3/4: The canteen is mostly full
3/4 - 1/2: The canteen is little more then half way full
1/2: The canteen is about half full
1/2 - 1/4: The canteen is a little less then half full
1/4: The canteen is about a quarter full
1/4 - Empty: The canteen is almost empty
Empty: The canteen is empty

Subject Skill Degrade Suggestions~
Text
Currently all skills degrade. When you create a character it asks you to pick a class. I suggest that the skills of that class degrade at 1/2 the current rate.
 
I also suggest a command Memorize be implemented. One would type memorize (skill) and that skill would not degrade at all. The number of memorized skills would be based on intelligence / wisdom.
Typing memorized would give you a list of memorized skills and the number of remaining memorizes.

Subject Mobile Suit Weapon ranges~
Text
Kinda noticed that some weapons have a significantly
longer range of fire as compared to other that one
would assume to be the better as far as range is
concerned. Point in case, the Virgos. They use what
we can assume to be the 100mm Machine Gun. A decent
weapon, with range that for some reason outclasses
the Twin Buster Rifle, a colony destroyer. So I
guess to get to the point, is it possible to look
over and re-treak weapon range values? Just a thought

Subject Battleship Location Changes~
Text
Libra, Barge, and Peacemillion pretty much spawn within
500 vector units, making it nearly IMPOSSIBLE to to survive
a skirmish in system X. Bewtween the 3 battleships and
the numerous Virgos that spawn pretty rapidly. If its
possible to change the spawn locations, I'd suggest
having Libra spawn in the L3 colonly cluster somewhere
withing a 5000 distance of White Fang Base. Seeing as
White Fang stole and completed the Libra, makes sense.
As for Peacemillion and Fortress Barge, they can both
be placed both in the Terra system, or just Peacemillion.
Either way works. Peacemillion could be placed within
1000 units in all points of Earth or the Moon (if Barge
isnt placed in the Terra system, in which case Barge
can be moved within 1000 units of the moon). If Barge
is not placed within the Terra system, then possibly
the G42 system, within say 2000 units or so of the Oz
Base. Even though it seems like alot of work, its really
a simple thing to change, a low level builder can probably
do it. All it involves is changing the resets. Very simple
 
Thanks for reading all this. Normally I'd kinda let it
go to an extent, but I just got ass raped sideways by 
all 3 battleships and 4 Virgos as soon as I entered the
X system at vectors 1000 1000 1000 and 5000 5000 5000.
Bitches move pretty fast for that much armor, lol.
So yea...I died...wasnt fun. No matter where I tried
to flee to, there was SOMETHING in the way preventing
my escape, wasnt the most favorable death, more like
most frustrating.

Text
Just a thought as I dont mean to offend anyone, but I 
think it would be a good idea to give at least 1 (ONE)
of your staff members shell access. As much as it pains
me to say this, we hardly ever see you here Gunther
buddy. And we need our imm staff to keep things running
smoothly in your absence. I see Scoyn on consistantly 
and more than any other Imm or player for that matter.
 
The reason for shell access is simple. Sometimes shit
happens, and when it happens, it a pain in everyones ass
We need someone to be able to reboot the mud in your
absence. While normally the mud goes pretty smooth...
the last 2 days gives proof that we need someone to step
in and keep things going when life keeps you busy.
 
Once again just a thought. And if you cant find a single
person on your staff you can trust with the task of 
rebooting and keeping things going, then either you need
new staff or somethings gotta give.
