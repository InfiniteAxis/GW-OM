Desc       You look this Bounty Hunter up and down and realize that he is far much
more experienced than you realized. He is a master in Bounty Hunting and
has set up an office for those who know how to find him in order to give
them experience and knowledge for hunting as he once did.  A reminder of
his past is present on his right cheek under his dark eyes. A long jagged
scar now grey with age graces his face and his once dark hair is now
streaked heavily with iron grey. His well muscled physique is the only
thing that gives him a remotely young appearance.

Desc     This is the Colony S19 Turbolift. In general this is a giant elevator that
takes people to and from the different levels of the colony. You are on a
small platform along with a few other people and there are many hundred of
platforms in the turbolift. There is a constant rush of wind as people are
moving down levels. There is a voice recognition module near you. Just
tell the module whether you want to go up or down.

Desc     You find yourself lazily swimming around. You cant help but feel awed as
many different varieties of fish swim below you in the deep waters. You do
believe you can float around here forever. Maybe this is why the original
colonists chose to create such splendor. So you could get lost in it all.

Desc     You look all about you and see the shore not too far to the north. A calm
serenity envelopes you as you swim along the ocean waves. The deep blue of
the sea feels good against your skin. A defintely change from what you are
used to on other colonies.

Desc     You stand on the shoreline staring out at what appears to be endless blue
water. Perhaps it is just you but this colony seems alot bigger than it
shows. Perhaps a trip around the waters will show you if this is really as
endless as it looks. As you look down you see a shell and smile. It
defintely looks like earth.

Desc     You've gone down under the docks and as you stand underneath them you can
hear the waves lap at the steady wooden posts. Shellfish hasnt become
attached to the docks just yet but you can see the colonists created an
almost perfect earth-like representation of an old dock.

Desc     Welcome to the Blue Star Hotel's upper rooms. If you have purchased a key
you may enter the rooms. All the locks are unpickable. So I wouldnt try
doing that. Also enjoy the luxury of these deluxe rooms. The east door is
a blue painted door leading to the blue room. The west door is painted
green leading to of course the green room. To the south is the other 2
fine rooms we offer the Gold and Silver rooms. Enjoy your stay with us.

Desc     You've entered the Blue room. It is decorated well in blue. And as you look
around you sense there is a nautical theme about this room. Perhaps the
net in the corner of the room or the bed shaped like the bow of a ship
give it away. Either way it looks comfortable.
