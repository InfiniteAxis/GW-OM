even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

Tell and Reply now save messages. If you're fighting, link-dead, or AFK, 
the incoming tells will save to your CDI. You can read the messages simply
by using the CHECK command.

                MOVING THROUGHOUT GAME:
                ---------------------------
The game divided into many rooms which are connected by various
directionals to make up areas.  When you are in a room, you can
find the exits in the room by typing EXITS.  Autoexit is a helpful
command to initiate (type CONFIG +AUTOEXIT), because it will
automatically show you what exits there are in the room.  Be warned
however, you will only see the obvious exits.  You must pay attention
to the room descriptions to see if there might be any doors or hidden
passages in the room. 

Directional commands: (in parentheses you find the shorthand)
NORTH (n)    SOUTH (s)    EAST (e)    WEST (w)     UP (u)     DOWN (d)
NORTHEAST (Ne)  NORTHWEST (Nw)  SOUTHEAST (Se)  SOUTHWEST (Sw)
 	
Note:  You will notice that in the prompt <20hp 10bp 20mv>, the 'mv'
       refers to your movement points.  If your movement points were
       to run out, you will be unable to move between rooms due to 
       exhaustion.  If you type SLEEP or REST your movement points will
       slowly be replenished.  You must type STAND or WAKE before 
       walking again.
~

1001 AASSIGN~
&YSyntax : aassign <filename>.are Example: aassign gundamw.are
&G 
AASSIGN temporarily assigns all rooms, objects, and mobiles in the area
range to your pfile.  This allows you to use rlist, olist, mlist, and
reset list.  This also means that typing savearea, reset area, or 
instazone will affect this area.  
 
To save changes permanently, type "aassign none" and foldarea.
 
Warning!! Do not have an area assigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.
 
In order to assign a proto area to yourself, you must either have that
area bestowed to you or you must be Greater God+.
 
In order to assign a non-proto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by a member of the Area Council or you must
be Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed to you, only Lesser+
can assign themselves non-proto areas.
 
See BESTOWAREA
 
~

1001 ABIT~
Syntax : abit <person>
Syntax : abit <person> <abit>

If no abit is specified after the player's name, this will list all the 
temporary abits (bits that don't save) on the specified person. If you
specify the number of an abit after their name, it will toggle that bit
on or off.

Addsalary is a recent addition to clan commands by Cray/Trowa. This command
allows a leader of any clan to grant a salary of any monetary unit to any
clan members. This command can be used to make sure someone in the clan

given to them by the leader.

~

1001 ADVANCE~
&YSyntax: advance <character> <level>
&G
ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It may also be
used to demote a character.
~

1001 ADVANCEDEXITS~
&G
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction,
as well as the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one,
use a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to
refer to it by number:
redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
 
To know what number an exit is, do an "rstat".
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one
of the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It is also usually a good
idea to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
If a player types 'swim' in the room, they will move to room 3001.

-1 ADVENTURE~
&G
   In our efforts to give credit to everyone who deserves it, we almost
   forgot to give credit to one of the "grandfathers" of computer adventure
   games... David Platt, the author of the original "Adventure" (c)1979.

   Also credit to Ken Wellsch for porting the original Fortran-77 version
   to UNIX-C (over a period of about 3 years) (c)1984.
~

1 ADVERTISE~
&GDoing this is completely illegal. You advertise another mud on any
channel, be it public or private, you get deleted. There are no ands ifs
or buts about the subject. You do it, and you kiss your pfile goodbye. 
~

0 AFFECTED 'AFFECTED BY'~
&YSyntax:  affected       (abbreviation:  af)
&YSyntax:  affected by    (abbreviation: af by)
&G 
'Affected' is a powers-at-a-glance function, which displays only the powers
(and skill affects) your character is currently under.  Each affect will be
listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <power/skill name> or 'score').
 
Characters level 20 or above and deadly characters will also see the number
of rounds remaining for each affect.  Affects with a remaining lifespan of
less than 25 rounds are displayed in white, and those in immediate danger
of wearing off will flash.
 
'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its power/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.
 
'Affected by' also displays your current susceptibilities, resistances and
immunities if your character is level 20 or higher.
 
~

1001 AFFECTEDBY AFFECTED_BY~
&G
The following are affect flags that can be used when osetting an item
(with oset <item> affect affected <affect flag>).  These flags can also
be used when msetting a mobile (mset <mob name> affected <affect flag>).
They may additionally be used to mset players if your level allows it.
 
Blind          Invisible    Detect_evil  Detect_invis  Detect_magic
Detect_hidden  **Hold**     Sanctuary    Faerie_fire   Infrared

1 AFK~
&YSyntax: afk <messege/preset>
&YPreset: Food, Dog, BrB, Boo.
&G
The afk command has been changed to include an argument. The
argument acts as a default messege that will show on the "who"
list. As well, preset messeges have been added for your convienence.
You don't have to set an argument, and a default afk messege will be
set instead.

Also when activated it will inform all incoming tells that you are
afk. It can be toggled on or off by typing afk and will also go off
automatically when you type any command.

1001 ALLOW BAN~
&YSyntax:  allow <site>
&YSyntax:  ban   <site>
&YSyntax:  ban
&YSyntax:  ban <# of ban on ban list> level <level of char to ban and below>
&G 
BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.
 
BAN with no arguments returns an enumerated list of banned sites.
 
To set a specific level of character to ban from a site, use 'ban' to get
the list number of the banned site and then use 'ban level'.
Example:  ban 2 level 10
 
This will ban all characters level 10 and under from the second site on
the 'ban' list.
 
ALLOW <site> removes a site from the ban list.
 
The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

the auction channel from your screen, type CHANNEL -AUCTION.

Auction code has been greatly modified, multi auctioning is now in!

&RIf you auction FAKE items: We don't care who you are, we don't care if
you "didn't" know.. We'll balzhur you, its as simple as that. Auction
isn't meant to be abused. DEAL WITH IT.

1001 BADNAME~
&YSyntax: badname <name> add
&YSyntax: badname <name> remove
&G
The "badname" command enables us to specify certain names that are
reserved and cannot be used by players.
 
We can specify names that we want to reserve because they belong to
former imms. We can specify names that are often tried and are a bit
of a pain (like Killer or Satan or Seth).
 
We can specify parts of names by preceding the string with an "*".
e.g.  reserve *goof add This will prevent any name with the sub string 
"goof" ... like ... "goofface", "biggoof" or "biggoofface".
All deity names should be reserved.
 
badname                        list current reserved names
badname joe add                add joe to the list if he's not on it
badname joe remove             remove joe from the list if he is on it
badname *goof add              add the sub string "goof" to the list

0 BASH~
&YSyntax:  bash
&G
Bash can only be used once a fight has started.  It will inflict damage and
temporarily daze both yourself and your opponent for approximately two rounds
during which you cannot heal, flee or perform other extraneous combat actions
(i.e. you will be able to dodge/parry/attack but nothing else).  These same
consequences are inflicted on your opponent if it is a player character,
otherwise the skill only inflicts damage.
 
Note that bash has a drastically reduced chance of hitting if the basher is
not one of the primary targets (i.e. is not tanking).

basically has a weapon, while the pimp goes in with a hoe.

Funny yet effective combat. ^_^

1 BOMB~
&YSyntax: Bomb &b<&BColony&b/&BPlanet&b>

&GBombing is an evil thing here, basically since the radical
new technology of Nano-Tech shielding, beam weapons are utterly
useless on colonies, so you now have to resort to bomb droppings.

you will no doubt damage a few people >=)

~

1 BOTTING BOT~

Botting is a punishable offense. Botting simply put is the use of an
infinite loop of triggers while you are away from your computer. Any use of
a "bot" can and will evoke a serious punishment. If caught botting for a
specific task such as combat levels or getting credits/gold That level or
credits will be automatically dropped down to 1. All money will be
confiscated and you may incur time in hell.  The use of triggers is
allowed as long as the player is there to stop the triggers at any given
time. So long as the player is there and can be proven to be there The use
of a trigger is approved. Infinite trigger loops are also considered
botting. Just remember some people direct telnet here or their clients do
not have the ability to use triggers or bots. Excessive use of these is
unfair to others. Please remember that you will be punished for this if
caught. 
 
 
&RNote: If you're grouped with the botter, that's enough to get you with the 
SAME punishment! Ignorance is NOT, nor EVER an excuse!

 &G- &RIf you're non-pk, no bountying for you!
 &G- &RYou need a REASON! Refer to help ICPK!
 &G- &RSomone being PPK is not a reason for bountying! A different ICPK reason

&RIf you can't use a certain channel, it doesn't mean you can misuse 
another. Getting killed then asking for help on ooc isn't allowed.
Just because you don't have a CDI, doesn't mean you can say IC stuff
on OOC channels.

If you don't follow these rules, you get silenced. If you misuse after 
that, you get silenced for a longer amount of time. IF you somehow are

1 CLANBUYSHIP~
&YSyntax : clanbuyship <ship name>
&G
This buys a ship for your clan out of clan funds, you must be empowered
by your clan to do this. You can buy ships clanships like peacekeepers,
and even capital ships with this skill, all of which may only be
owned by the specified clans.

See EMPOWER
~

1 CLANRULES~
&B&W1. &gEach clan will have built 8 mobile suits fitted specifically for  
   that organization.  A Midship and a Capitalship will also be assigned  
   to each clan.  Each clan may not have any more ships or MS than that. 
   In addition, each clan may have a maximum of 4 members who own a 
   Gundam.  If more than 4 own a Gundam, the player will either be 
   removed from the clan or have his or her Gundam confiscated.  Those
   Gundams can be used in war situations.  
 
&B&W2. &gIn a war situation, the only Mobile Suits or ships that can  
   participate in the war are clan-owned ones.  If a clan is blockading  
   a certain sector, then they must request the identity of any privately  
   owned Mobile Suits before attacking, and ask them to leave.  If the  
   pilot refuses to leave, and is PK, then the clan may attack them.
 
&B&W3. &gIf you are a Clan Leader, and your member total falls below 5 for
   a week straight, you will lose Leadership of that clan.  Another  
   person will be appointed leader to try and improve on the clan.  
 
&B&W4. &gIf you are a Clan Leader and you are killed, do NOT whine to an  
   Immortal to reimburse you as clan Leader. You died, you lost the   
   leadership for now.   
 
&B&W5. &gIf you are a Leader, you cannot have your alts in the top 2 Ranks 
   of your clan. You    may have alts in your clan, but ONLY as regular
   members.
 
&B&W6. &gCapturing a planet, destroying/hijacking a ship or mobile suit,
   or pkilling a player that belongs to a clan is reason for you to be  
   killed.  Or in the case that the offender is in another clan, war. 
 
&B&W7. &gSimply, do not embezzle clan funds.  Clan funds are for the clan. 
   Embezzlers are subject to a punishment decided by clan leaders or  
   other members of the clan.  This can range from being outcast to  
   death.
 
&B&W8. &gClan leaders, please take note, we do not want one all powerful  
   clan with a bunch of small factions.  Try not to take all of the  
   strong players into one clan. The MUD will be more fun for everyone.  
 
&B&W9. &gNo capturing planets that belong to a clan you are not at war
   with.  Its just unrealistic.

are designed to only work for specific causes: KILL only works on
Mobs, while MURDER only works on Players (&YSee HELP PK&G).

&R***Note*** MURDER causes the player to cry out.&G

You may find yourself in trouble during a fight, and wish to leave. 
This can be done by using FLEE. You may also set it up to flee 
automatically once you go below a certain number of Hit Points

<Number of HP>. Leaving a fight with wimpy and flee will cost you a 
loss of experience.&D

1 DEATH~
&GDeath in this mud isn't permanent, unlike other SWR muds.
When you die here, you're sent to the morgue.

Your corpse remains where you were killed at, and your items can be
retrieved. (Providing whoever killed you didn't take it
all.)
 
 &G- &RDon't bother immortals about your death! See Help Reimbursement!
 &G- &RAny mobile suit you had before death is lost when you die.
 &G- &R..Try not to die!
 
&GFor about 6 months we ran on perm death Folks.
 
You lost EVERY level you had on death.
You lost EVERY object you had on death.
You lost EVERY suit you had on death.
You lost EVERY dollar!
You lost EVERY damn thing you owned! EVERYTHING!!!
Now you lose anything you're carrying, including held money.
But omg! You can actually get it back by running to your corpse.
You Also lose your suit, but oh no! *Points to the list above*
If you're stupid enough to not bank money, you deserve to have
your corpse looted. Any bitching about how hard death is will
get you one thing, a visit from Balzhur. And it'll just be like
perm death.. awww.. You'll lose everything. So don't bitch and
moan.

   will be able to poison a weapon.
 
Dexterity is also very important for quaffing potions in combat.  High dex
will allow you to quaff without dropping many potions during the heat of
battle, while a poor dexterity will cause you to accidentally drop many
of the valuable vials.

&YSyntax:  dig
&YSyntax:  dig  <direction>
&YSyntax:  bury <item>
&G 
You can dig and bury items through the use of the dig skill and bury command.
Buried items are not visible to players, even through the use of powers such
as locate object.  To dig an item up, type dig with no arguments.  Having a
shovel raises your chance of success.  If you dig in a direction, you will
attempt to dig open an exit.
 
To bury an item (or corpse), drop the item on the ground and bury <item>.
Depending on the size and weight of the object, you might need a shovel.
 
* Note:  Deadly players can bury/dig up each other's corpses. *
 
Items buried will not last beyond crash or reboot.  Do not attempt to use
this skill for storage of items you wish to keep.

                     Additional contributions from:

 Michael Curran  - the player title collection and additional locations.
 Bill Wisner     - for being the first to successfully port the game,
                   uncovering several old bugs, uh, inconsistencies,
                   in the process.

         And: Mads Haar and Stephan Dahl for additional locations.

  The Original DIKUMud was Developed at the Department of Computer Science

&G
Drink instructs your character to drink from a fountain or a drink container
to alleviate thirst.
 
Eat instructs your character to eat an item of food or a magical pill (which
function in a similar fashion as potions); pills do not fill stomach space.
 
When you are hungry or thirsty (you will see messages at each tick that
tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with either 'score' or 'oldscore'), you will not regain
hit points, movement points or force back as rapidly as if you were well
fed and hydrated.
 
If you stay hungry or thirsty too long and you are not an Avatar, your
mental state will begin to suffer.  Your combat skills will be affected,
your coordination will suffer and you may begin to either hallucinate or
become depressed.  Eating, drinking and a little rest will solve this
problem after a short period of time.

~

1001 ECONOMY~
&G
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.
 
The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).
 
To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.
 
The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).
 
Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).
 
Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permanent.

1001 EXITMAKING~
&G
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
For more than one exit in the same direction see ADVANCEDEXITS.

The &YSyntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.

     64 - Need to be able to fly to go that way
    128 - Need to be able to climb to go that way
   1024 - Door is Passdoor proof

NOTE: You must ADD the values together to generate an exit-type:
        3 = a closed door
        7 = a closed and locked door
       11 = a closed secret door
       15 = a closed, locked and secret door

-- Use the 'redit exflags' command to change these flags, and to set the
   advanced exit flags, most of which are not shown above.

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep

automatically join the fight.
 
If character is already a member of your group, using 'group <character>'
will remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group
does not stop them from following you, however.  A character can also
leave your group by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they
will both leave your group and stop following you.
 
'Group' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
You may follow lower level characters or characters up to ten levels higher.
You may group only characters within eight levels of your own.

1 GANG GANGS~
Gangs are the new version of clans that you see in other MUDs. No, this is not
a rip off of GTA. It was actually thought of during a certain movie. 
Anyways.

Gangs can be bought by anyone who meets the requirements. Along with being
able to initiate players into your gang, you'll also have NPC members roaming
your turf. NPC gang members will join or leave depending on your overal respect
rating of your turf. If need be, you can pay to have NPC members join you.

Money is gained by either donations, or by what your "Hustlers" bring in for
your gang. Money is spent on getting NPC members, and whatever else your
little heart desires.

Gangs are identifiable by their colours, which are shown on the who list.
On mobs the colours are before their name in the room when you look.

0 HEADS HEAD BOUNTYHUNTING~
&GThroughout the MUD, you'll occasionally come across heads from mobs you've
slain. These are "BOUNTY HEADS," and these are your ticket to getting bounty
hunting levels.
 
Bounty heads are found on select mobiles, and are worth a set amount of
BH exp. per head.
 
Bounty hunting is by and far the hardest skill set to level in the game,
so players will also pay high sums for them. But don't forget to get a
few BH levels for yourself. ;)
 
The Bounty Hunting Office is located in S19. This is where you'll turn
in your heads for experience. To turn in your heads, simply type:
 
&Ybounty gain
&G
You'll instantly gain experience for each head presently in your inventory
(NOT INCLUDING HEADS IN CONTAINERS).

including ^bbackground^x colors.  However, there are a couple of quirks to take
note of:
&Y
    1) If the first line of your help file containers a color code and you are
       experiencing a display problem with the file, use a . to begin the file.
    2) Color changes should be separated by at least one character.  Example:
       '&&Y.^^r' will work, '&&Y^^r' may cause problems.

1001 HELL UNHELL~
&YSyntax: hell <character> <number> <hours or days>
&YSyntax: unhell <character>
&G 
The hell command sends a character to hell for a given period of time.  It
automatically releases the character when their time has been served.  Upon
being helled, the character receives the message, "The immortals are not 
pleased with your actions.  You shall remain in hell for <time period>."
 
Hell takes arguments of either hours or days.  To hell someone for 3 hours,
"hell <character> 3 hours."  To hell someone for three days, "hell <character>
3 days".  Hell will default to hours if hours or days is not specified.

To release a player from hell early, simply "unhell <character>".

1001 HELPCHECK~
&G
Helpcheck is a level 1001 or higher command. This command enables the user
to check what does and does not have a helpfile. Such as commands, areas
and skills/spells.  This is most helpful when a new command comes into
play and hasn?t had a helpfile created for it yet. 
 
&YSyntax: helpcheck
 
~

1001 HELPFILE FILE HELPFILES~
&G
To edit/make a help file there are some basic and yet confusing
commands
necessary.  So here we go...
hedit <helpfile>
hset level 1 <helpfile>
hset keyword "<word list>" <helpfile>
hset save <helpfile>
~

0 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
&YSyntax:  hide
&YSyntax:  sneak
&YSyntax:  visible
&G 
If you successfully HIDE, other characters and creatures cannot see you
unless they are affected by 'detect hidden'.
 
If you successfully SNEAK, you can move from place to place without being
noticed by other characters.
 
In order to HIDE or SNEAK successfully, you must practice the appropriate
skill.
 
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
effectively making you visible again to all.
~

1 HIJACK~
&C&YSyntax&c: &zHijack &c<&zLaunch Code&c>
&G
Hijacking has been changed here. To hijack you MUST figure
out the suits correct launch code. Hijacking doesn't allow
you free access to the code, just access to input it. If
you do not guess the correct launch code, which consists
of 2 numbers, but that?s still 99 tries, you will be forced
from the suit by computer defenses.

  &r-&R=&PT&phings &Pt&po &PR&pemember&R=&r- 
&C1&c. &BDon't hijack suits that belong to Non-PK's!
&C2&c. &BIf you are NON-PK, do NOT hijack pk player owned suits!
&C3&c. &BHijacking is a PKable offense.
&C4&c. &BIf the suit is unowned, its alright to hijack.
&C5&c. &BNon Pk's CAN'T hijack Gundams. They're &RPK ONLY&B. Hahaha =)

1 HISCORE~
&YSyntax hiscore &b[&Bkeyword&b]

&GThis command is used to see a hiscore charts. Without an argument,
it lists all the charts. If you supply a argument, it will show you
the table, unless the table is set to be visible only by looking
at the appropriate sign.
~

1001 HISCOSET~
&YSyntax hiscoset &b [&Bkeyword&b] [&Bfield&b] [&Bvalue&B]
&G
&GHiscoset is the command to set and create hiscore tables.

Command can be:
    list                     Lists all hiscore tables.
    show                Shows the data for that table.
    create              Create new table with that keyword.
    destroy             Destroy table with that keyword.
    set     Sets data for that table.

Field can be:
    keyword             Set new keyword for the table.
    vnum                Set an object vnum for this table.
    desc                Set the description.
    maxlength           Set Max entries in the table.
    entry       Change the score for a player.

If the 'vnum' field is -1, the table will be accessible via the
'hiscore' command; if it's different from -1, it will be visible
only by looking at the object with that vnum.
If you decrease maxlength, entries at the end will be chopped. If
you increase it, it will slowly fill up.

1 HITALL~
&YSyntax: hitall
&G
This skill is used to simultaneous hit all NPC's in the room. Watch out
though, using it against too many at once can prove to be fatal. Useful
for clearing a room of weak mobs quickly.
~

~

1 HLIST~
&YSyntax: hlist <low level range> <high level range>
&G 
This command will give you a listing of available help files. The list
is in alphabetical order based on the first triggering keyword. While
this command was initially designed as a maintenance tool to help us
track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them. 
 
Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.
 
Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.
 
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
&YSyntax:  hold   <object>
&YSyntax:  remove <object>
&YSyntax:  remove all
&YSyntax:  wear   <object>
&YSyntax:  wear   all
&YSyntax:  wield  <object>
&G 
Three of these commands will cause you to take an object from your inventory
and use it as equipment:
 
HOLD is for lights, wands and staves; WEAR is for armor; WIELD is for weapons.
 
You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.
 
WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD/WEAR/WIELD each suitable item in inventory.
 
REMOVE will take an object from your equipment and place it into inventory.
 
REMOVE ALL will remove all your equipment and place it into inventory.
 
~

1 HOLOSUIT~
&G
Holosuit - All the normal suit commands work while you're in here. It costs
just a bit of money to use, but you can fight in space without any risk of
dying, while still gaining experience. Mind you, the experience will
eventually die down after you raise in levels. Landing holosuits on
midships or capships to take them to other sectors is STRICTLY forbidden
and will result in punishment.

~

1001 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
&YSyntax: holylight
&YSyntax: invis
&G
HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which 
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A 
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will 
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.
~

10 HOMEPAGE~
&YSyntax: homepage <url>
&G 
example: homepage http://www.idirect.com/test.html
 
If you have a web page somewhere, you can use the homepage
command to show people a link to that page whenever they
select the 'see who's on' link from the Realms of Despair
home page.
 
To remove your homepage setting, type 'homepage clear'.

1001 HOMUNCULUS SEVEN SINS~
The Homunculi are a race of humans which were created artificially by
alchemy. The process in which this happens is caused by a human
transmutation and resurrection, when used with alchemy.  The original
body is usually mutated into something other than human, almost
resembling a monster.  In which that body has to die, but another is
born into the world, with the exact same features as the human that
the resurrection attempt failed upon.  This is when the Homunculi is
born.  Each of the homunculi possess no soul, but the regular functions
as a human would.  On the other hand, they do possess otherworldly,
unique powers, which they used to their advantage.  They also are named
after the seven deadly sins.

1 HOTEL~
&G
Cray's favorite place to go --
I mean, the Hotels around the MUD are designed for saving and quitting, as well
as checking Board Messages (See&YHELP NOTE&G).

See &YHELP HAIL&D, &YHELP NOTE&D, &YHELP QUIT&D, &YHELP SAVE&D.
~

1 'HP'~
&GAbbreviated form of hit points, this is how much health you have. All
classes begin with 500 hp and gain 15 hp per level. Certain equipment has
hp modifiers that can add to your total hp as well.
~

1 HPFIX~
Notice anything about your &RHP&w? It's been automatically adjusted to a new level.
Here on out, random &RHP&w will be given out when you gain levels.
(If you don't understand what that means: check when you level next. 
The &RHP&w will be random).
 
This will be implemented to make things different. It's better than 15 per
level. This also gave Cray a great opportunity to incorporate &BCON&w with &RHP&w/Level
gaining. Your &BCON&w now affects how much HP you gain per level. 
 
&RNote&w: Damage has also been altered...down.

1001 HSET~
&YSyntax:  hset  <command> [value] [help topic]
 save                            Saves all help pages (to help.are)
 level <level> <help topic>      Sets help topic to specified level
 keyword <keyword> <help topic>  Sets help keyword to specified keyword
 remove <level.><help topic>     Removes the specified help page
&G 
Note:  If you wish to set more than one keyword to a help topic, enclose all
       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  (Like in powercasting)
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:
 
       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.

1 HYPERSPACE LIGHTSPEED~
&YSyntax :  Calculate (system) (x) (y) (z)
             Then Hyperspace or Lightspeed
&G 
Hyperspace is used to jump from one system to another in the
galaxy. It is much faster than conventional space travel
as well as a bit more dangerous. If you get a Jump warning
odds are you will collide with something when you jump into
the system

1 IC OOC "IN CHARACTER" " OUT OF CHARACTER"~
&C

IC - In character - Means that you're not chatting with your friends about
Friday nights plans, or what to wear to the mall, it means what your MUD
CHARACTER is saying. Ignorance is  no excuse for misusing channels, if you
mean to jokingly tell someone OOC you're going to kill them but do it IC
they have every right to defend themselves and attack you if they feel
threatened. You can use the ask and answer, as well as tell channels (if
you don't understand  them there's a reason someone teaches languages)
if; you want to talk OOC or just go to a hotel, it's not that difficult and
it's cheaper then using IC and clears up any confusion and lessens whining
because someone was killed because they "accidentally said the wrong
thing on the wrong channel".
&Y
OOC - Out of Character - Means you're talking about issues not
game related like a bug or have another mud-based question, this
does not mean you go "Hey Jim I need food pick me up" or "Hey 
So and So just killed me I'm gonna get you!" however there are a 
constantly growing number of help files and most of your basic 
questions should be there for answering, but yes there are times
here there are questions only an imm or a fellow player can answer.
However Excessive abuse of OOC will result in possibly being silenced.

1 IGNORE~
&YSyntax: ignore
&YSyntax: ignore <character>
&G 
Ignore allows you to completely block out any and all forms of 
communication or action from any character you select. You will not see 
their global communications, their in-room communications, their social 
actions, or their tells. You will also not be heard on any of these 
communication channels by the ignored character. You will not be listed as 
a person in the room with them, or be seen on the who list by them. Think 
of it as a stealth field to keep the character from ever knowing you 
exist.
 
Typing 'ignore' by itself will list your currently ignored players.
 
Typing 'ignore <character>' will add or remove that character from your list
of ignores. Only valid character names can be added, it will check to see
if that person has a pfile.
 
Typing 'ignore none' will clear your ignore list.
~

1001 IMMCHANNEL~
&G
Immchannel is a channel created for imms only to talk back and forth with
out having to send tells. This is good for when an immortal wants all
immortals on to hear what s/he is saying. Immchannel is also useful for
various other reasons. Basically it keeps immortal business to the
immortals.
 
&YSyntax: immchannel <what you wish to
say>

~

1 INITIATE~
&YSyntax: Initiate <prospect> <target>
Syntax: Initiate Decline


&GInitiate is what gets people into your gang. You send them on a hunt
after other players. Once they kill that person, they're automatically
set into your gang. You can give them a target of even offline players
but giving them an immortal as a target will net you deletion. Yay :P

If you were given an initiation, you can clear it with the "Decline"
option.
~

1001 INSTALLAREA~
&YSyntax:  installarea <area filename> <full area name/title>
&G 
Installs a prototype area into the mud as a non-prototype area.  The
filename can be fixed with aset (don't forget to foldarea afterwards).
 
Installarea renames the installed area file from 'author.are.file' to
'author.are.installed' so that the builder may be assigned new vnums.
 
~

1001 INSTAROOM INSTAZONE~
&YSyntax:  instaroom
&G 
Functions the same as instazone, but is room-based instead of area-based.
 
&YSyntax:  instazone [nodoors]
&G 
This command lets your instantly create a whole set of resets for your area
based on all the mobiles and objects contained within your area.
All you have to do is place each mob in its proper room, wearing what it
should be wearing, carrying what it should be carrying, and objects in their
proper places, or in their proper containers, and doors in their proper
states, (open, closed, locked).  The instazone command will clear out your
current resets (if any), and create new ones for you.
You may optionally specify "nodoors" so that door resets will not be
created.
 
NOTE:  This command will wipe out any existing resets!  Do not use this
command after you have added your own resets with 'reset add'.
The recommended procedure is to use instazone, then use the 'reset' command
to add any special resets, and NOT use instazone again.
 
See RESET and RESETCMDS.
~

1 INTELLIGENCE INT~
&G
Intelligence (INT in your 'score') represents your character's mental
capacity.  Among other things, it affects:
 
 - heavily influences the amount of force a character gains at level
 
 - affects the amount of force regenerated or recovered at each tick
   if a character is resting or sleeping
 
 - the rate at which a character learns a new skill or power
  
Intelligence is an important factor in learning between combatants.  If
a character fights an enemy  several times, the more intelligent of the
two opponents will gain an advantage over time...
~

1 INVITE~
&YSyntax : invite <player>
&G 
This allows you to invite players into your home.  Make sure the have
ringged your doorbell first.

Languages alone shows which languages you know, and "language learn 
<name>" will add to your percentage of language knowledge.  To learn a 
language, a scholar who is knowledgeable in that tongue must be present.

If someone is speaking in a language, and you know it, you will 
understand what they are saying.  However, to change the language in which 
you are speaking, you must change that manually.  (See help on SPEAK).

1001 LAYERS~
&gLayers are currently available on the following wear locations:
 
&GAbout, Arms, Body, Feet, Hands, Legs, Waist.
 
&gLayers are set with a numeric value, or combination of values.  The lower
the value, the lower the layer, or thinner the item of clothing/armor is.
 
Valid numeric values are:
 
&G0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
 
&gOr any combination of the above. A value of zero means no other items came
be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.

1 LEAVESHIP~
&YSyntax : leaveship
&G
Leaves the current ship (at hatch).
~

0 LEVEL~
&YSyntax:  level
&G 
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  Type LEVEL to see
how many experience points you'll need for the next few levels.
 
You gain experience by:
    inflicting damage upon an opponent
    being part of a group that kills an opponent
    succeeding while learning a skill or a power through real world usage
 
You lose experience by:
    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of some powers (energy drain, etc.)
    dying
 
The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:  how many 
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster;
your alignment versus the monster's alignment and some random variation.
 
Your last 25 kills are recorded.  Each time you kill a creature that has
been one of your last 25 kills you will receive less and less exp for it.
The creature will also learn from its experience with you over time; if
its intelligence is higher than your own it will begin to gain an
advantage over you in combat.

1001 LIGHTENERGY~
The 'Light Energy' skill is a passive skill that allows the player to 
use Light Energy weapons on Mobile Suits. Light Energy weapons 
are more or less defined by whether they can be used in a Suit's hand 
or not, and whether it's as large as a Bazooka or not. Obviously, 
if the weapon is hand-held (By a Suit), and is not a Bazooka-style 
weapon, it is considered Light Energy.
~

1 LIMBER~
&YSyntax : limber
&G

~

1 LIMITER~
&GFormer OZ soldier Lucrezia Noin came before the council with the idea to 
implant special neural chips into the minds of the people at birth. These 
chips, called "&YLimiters&G" would supress the violent tendencies in 
people to kill others.

It wasn't long before a procedure was developed by which one could cripple 
the Limiters effectiveness greatly. However, this procedure was not 100% 
effective... For one to be able to resist its power, one would have to 
have a VERY good reason to harm another person, and no reason could compel 
them to harm one who still had a fully intact Limiter. The procedure, 
however, was deemed highly illegal. The powers that be could not control 
it, but instead have kept records of those that have undergone the 
procedure.

Now in the year AC197, the procedure has been nearly-perfected... The chip 
can be completely removed. A disastrous step forth in bypassing the 
technology created to keep the peace, those who have had this chip removed 
maintain very little respect for life. As with the other procedure, they 
still had limits as to how their aggression could be manifested... The 
killing of others with active Limiters was still impossible. Also, humans 
that had Limiters turned off could only be killed on the same terms that a 
PK could kill. Even with the chip removed, the brain had been exposed to 
the data for too long. However... Any that had undergone the removal 
procedure was fair game. They could be slaughtered at will, without an 
ounce of mercy. The fear of the various governments mounted...

1001 LOG SNOOP~
&YSyntax:  log   <character>
&YSyntax:  log   all
&YSyntax:  snoop <character>
&G
LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into the
server's log file and to the log channel.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent
character toggle that persists across reboots until removed.
 
Certain commands (such as password) are protected against LOG.  Conversely,
certain commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.
 
LOG ALL logs all character and mob commands and actions to the server's log
file, but does not send the output to the log channel.  It is a server-wide
toggle; it does not persist across reboots.
 
SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.  The
character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one character
at a time.  The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the
players  name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)
 
SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.

1 LOTTERY~
&YSyntax: Lottery buy <number>
&G
Buying a lottery ticket is a beautiful thing. You have to be in a ticket
selling place however. Now then, lottery tickets cost $5000, but that 
money is quadrupled and adds $20,000 to the total jackpot of the fund.

Number range is 0-9999. So basically you don't have a super chance of 
winning. And of course the overall jackpot depends on how many people have 
purchased tickets.

If you aren't on when the lottery numbers take place, you'll have 50 real 
time hours to log on and check to see if you're a winner. If you don't log 
on within 50 hours but you were the winner, you win nothing =). If there
isn't a winner, then the jackpot from the previous one carries over to the 
next, so less winners mean higher jackpots for you to win!

~

1001 MPAPPLY MPAPPLYB~
&YSyntax:  mpapply <victim>
&YSyntax:  mpapplyb <victim>
&G 
These commands are used in the pre-auth area to signal a new character's
authorization status.  When a character first enters the game, it will
be targeted by an 'mpapply <victim>' which will inform the immortals that
the character is waiting for authorization.  Once the character is
authorized, a mob will attempt to 'mapplyb <victim>' the character, and
the character will be sent into the actual game.
~

1001 MPASET MPQSET~
Syntax : mpaset <victim> <abit number>
Syntax : mpqset <victim> <qbit number>

Mobs can use this to toggle abits and qbits on a player. Let's say that you
had a mob that you wanted to give a different response if he had been there
already THIS LOGIN (note that to make it permanent you'd just need to use
a qbit instead). You could use the following to check the status of the bit
and respond properly:

&Yif hasabit($n) == 3100
say Welcome back, $n.
else
say You're new around here, aren't you, $n?
mpaset $n 3100
endif&w

Notice that after checking for the bit, the mob responds with the appropriate
greeting, then sets it on the 'else' if they had not been there yet. If you
want to check the opposite status of the bit (player hasn't been set with
that particular bit yet), use != instead.

Be warned, however, that its programs will still function as normal, the
mortal will simply see a 'someone' if it performs an action or an echo

another one of your characters.
 
Note: This results in an immediate deletion of your characters.
Note: IGNORACE IS NO EXCUSE. Just...read the rules.

ends up with something of Jill's, you will be deleted.

-1 M_BALZHUR_~
Suddenly out of nowhere, a hideous beast appears, bringing with it the
horrible smell of brimstone, death and decay!

The demon gives you the most evil and spine tingling sneer that makes you
fall to your knees, and release your bladder... 

The next second, the immense mass of slimy muscle and claws is all over you
...shredding you to a bloody mess!

Mercifully, everything goes black as it moves its widening maw towards your
head...
~

-1 M_GODLVL10_~
You are all powerful!
~

-1 M_GODLVL1_~
...Everything begins to fade to black.

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel
indeed much more free than you have ever felt before...

You float high into the heavens... a vortex of ever-changing curved beams
of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

A strange chorus of voices begins to sing indecipherable and long forgotten
words... the singing grows louder and louder... a million voices as one.

You feel yourself losing touch with reality... and all goes quiet.
~

-1 M_GODLVL2_~
...You begin to feel light-headed.

Your hands begin to tingle softly...
The feeling quickly grows into a strange radiating pulse of energy! 

The tingle rises up your arms and into your head, filing your mind with
visions of worlds of wonder, far off places, great towers, vast mountains,
oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...
 
You sense a feeling of wondrous potential and power in your hands...
Enough power to build and create these visions for yourself!

You feel much more powerful, eager and inspired!
~

-1 M_GODLVL3_~
&
...You feel slightly faint as your head begins to spin.

Your hands begin to tingle once more...
A vortex of energy starts to swirl throughout your hands, going faster
and faster... becoming almost painful! 

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magic rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...
 
You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

0 NAME NAMES~
&YSyntax name <newname>
&G 
This command allows an unauthed character to change their name.

  Example: A new player named Jondoe has his name denied. To change his
  name to 'Joe', Jondoe would simply type: &YName Joe&z.
&G 
When choosing a name, please try to choose one which is unique.
Good names help add to gameplay and will allow you to forge an 
identity for yourself. Simply put, your name should &RNOT &Gbe:

 &C-&c Nonsensical, unpronounceable or ridiculous.
 &C-&c Profane or derogatory as interpreted in any language.
 &C-&c Similar to that of any Immortal, major mob, or equipment.
 &C-&c Comprised of various letters like 'Lallall'.
 &C-&c Comprised of ranks or titles, such as 'Lord' or 'Master'.
 &C-&c Composed of singular descriptive nouns, adverbs or adjectives,
    as in 'Heart', 'Big', 'Flying', 'Broken', 'Slick' or 'Tricky'.
 - Any of the above in reverse, i.e., writing Joe as 'Eoj'.
 
&GPlease keep in mind this applies to every name.
Above are the guidelines which all immortals follow. In addition, 
they may have their own reasons for denying your name. The immortals
get the say in your name, if they don't think its acceptable, then
you must change it.

NOTE: Once a name has been deemed unacceptable, it will not be possible
for anyone else to try and log on with it in the future.
~

1 NAMES~
&G
The name of your character is very important.  As we are trying
to keep this a Role Play Mud please pick reasonable names.
Names of wee known start wars characters are frownd upon
and names with profanity or just plain stupid will be denied.
 
i.e. Luke, Vader, Han are well known names.
i.e  Fish Head, Supermanguy, are just plain stupid.

0 NEWPK~
&RThe whole PK/PPK distinction, as well as all it entails, has gotten terribly,
terribly old. Honestly, enough is enough. So the time has come to toss it:
There is now only ONE level of PK. No more "Where's the ICPK?" or "Hey, he
insulted me a lot in tells!" or "It's not legal to pay people to die without
ICPK!" No more. None. The whole "ICPK" thing is flawed, because it:
 
1) Places restrictions on things that are simply ridiculous. RP-wise, it's
   awful. Some magical force allows you to kill most people, but some only
   if you've got a super-good reason? Bullshit.
2) Makes a situation where lots of hearsay and the like are all an Immortal
   has to make his/her judgement calls on the legality of a PK. On one hand,
   sometimes, you can't prove ANY ICPK reason, and on others, you can easily
   fabricate just enough evidence to prove practically all of them. Such a
   hit or miss system of rules really needs to go, if possible.
 
So here's how it's going to work: Players formerly PPKs are now PKs. Being
PK now has all the benefits that being PK AND PPK previously had. No damage
to equipment, you can buy Gundams, and so on. All players who were previously
PK are now non-PK, WITH THE EXCEPTION of PKs currently in gangs. This means
that if you were PK, and owned a Gundam, you need to either go PK again once
you enter the game, or sell it.
 
In short: From this point on, you're either a &RP&rl&pa&ry&Re&rr&p-&rK&Ri&rl&pl&re&Rr, or you're not.
No more ICPK -- If you're PK, you can be killed whenever, wherever, for nothing
more than kicks.

&RINTRODUCTION
&B-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&GHello and Welcome to Gundam wing: Operation Meteor.
As you start to play, you enter the  GWOM Academy. Our suggestion is that 
you read all information about this game because Gundam Wing: Operation 
Meteor is a codebase unknown to many, and its way different than the other 
favorite codebases (as in example, Rom or Rot).

Even though you've choosen to be one of the 8 classes (Aka. "Piloting, 
Bounty Hunting, Combat, etc.") you can still practice and use the other 
classes skills.  To know what to do to get out of the academy read help 
start.

1001 NOKILL KILL NO~
&G
A 'nokill' flag has been added for NAMED mobs. It doesn't make sense
for some mobs to die and then suddenly be back alive again ( the ones
with names as opposed to ones like anonymous stormtroopers etc ).
This flag will cause the mob that has it to appear to flee before it
dies... It will still give experience but won't leave a corpse lying
around.

0 NOTE 'NOTE WRITE' 'NOTE READ' SUBJECT 'NOTE SYSTEM' SUBJECTS UNREAD~
&YSyntax

subject [name]              Notes, Ideas, Articles, Mistakes, or Personnel.
note                                    Reads next note.
note read [number]                      Reads a certain note.
note remove <number>                    Removes a note written by you.
note list [number]                      Shows up to number notes.
note write                              Posts a note.
note catchup                            Marks all notes in this board read.
unread                                  Shows you all unread notes.

&GThese commands are used for the new note system. Instead of just one 
board, there are several, each with its special purpose. 

Changing between the subjects is accomplished using the SUBJECT command. 
BOARD without any arguments gives you a list of all boards together with
number of unread message. 

To change subjects, type SUBJECT <name of the board>.

To read next unread note, type NOTE. To read a note with a specified number,
type NOTE READ <number>. Typing NOTE while in a board with no unread notes
shifts you to the next board. Note that unlike the standard note system, a 
note has the same number in NOTE LIST and NOTE READ.

Posting a message is as simple as writing NOTE WRITE. You will be moved 
into interactive mode, where all you see are prompts for the fields like 
To:, From: etc. You will be automatically put AFK while writing a note.

To see the list of the notes in the current board, type NOTE LIST. Typing
NOTE LIST <number> will list only <number> of the last notes in the area.

You can remove your own note by using NOTE REMOVE <number>. Implementors may
remove other people's notes. Implementors can also select how many days
their note is kept before being purged. Purging happens automatically at
bootup. Purged notes are not deleted, but saved into a file.

To let only immortals see your note, address it to "imm". To let players of
a specific level and above, address it to that level (no other recipients may
appear in that case).

&YThe base of this note system was created by 
Erwin S. Andreasen, erwin@andreasen.org.

~

1001 OSET~
&YSyntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>
         oset object on
&G 
If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE
flag, your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all
other instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that
obj will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything
that is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object
in the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if
you change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of
that vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to
that sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.
If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE
flag, your modifications will affect only that copy.
 
OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all
commands, commands will imply 'oset <object>'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON
gives you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of OSET ON,
simply type the word DONE. Example:
 
        oset staff on
        long A long gnarled staff of burnished oak lies here.
        type staff
        done

The "QUIT" command disconnects you from the MUD completely. Remember to use
this command if you plan to be gone for more than three minutes (Disconnecting
any other way results in your character going Link-Dead, which leaves it
vulnerable to violent actions). Prevention of this is not an Immortal's
responsibility. It is the player's.

One more thing: Always Quit in Hotels (For Shelter purposes).

1 'RANT'~
&GHeyo,

 After long thought, I think it was needed for me to post
why I do what I do.

 Understand this, regardless of what any of you think, be
you a Player, or Immortal of any level. This isn't a job
for me, this isn't a chore for me. Anything I do for help
or code, I do it when I feel like doing it.

 I don't have rich parents to support me, I don't have a
"Good paying" job. I bust my ass 12 hours a day of pure
manual labor, so when I get home, I'm exhausted.

 &RI'm tired of all the muttering, and the rumors that I
don't do my job here.&G You know why? Because this isn't
my damn job. This isn't something I do because I have to.
This is something I do when I get bored, or feel like
shoving a new idea into the code, or helping players out.

 Are you tired of having no clans? Guess what. I don't
friggin care. Are you tired of crashes? Guess what. I
don't friggin care. Are you tired of your stupid requests
not getting acknowledged? Guess what. You guessed it, if
you guess that I don't friggin care.

 If you don't like how things work, don't play here. If
you don't appreciate what I'm sending, don't play here.

 None of you pay shit all to play a free game. And so
many of you throw in so many countless hours of your
lives to do so. Just because you can sit around while
someone else pays your bills, doesn't mean everyone else
can. The ones that do have to support themselves, and log
when they can just to get away from it all, know exactly
how it is for me, and understand this. The ones who don't
can go play a pay-to-play game and hope that their $20 a
month gets them some sort of satisfaction, which it most
likely won't.

 If you feel the need to reply to my rant, then by all
means, send me a personal note. And maybe in my small
amount of free time, I'll read it.

 Thanks for either reading this or simply ignoring it.

1001 RASSIGN MASSIGN OASSIGN~
&YSyntax:  rassign <character> <begin vnum range> <end vnum range>
&G 
These commands allow you to assign a range of vnums to an immortal for
so that they may build inside that range.  Use the 'checkvnums' command
before assigning a range to ensure that there will be no vnum conflicts.
You can also use the 'vnums' command for a complete list of currently
allocated ranges, and the 'newzones' command for a complete list of
prototype vnum ranges.
 
Warning:  *Never* assign any vnums to a character who has another vnum
range assigned to them via 'aassign'.  Simply be sure to have the
character type 'aassign none' before assigning vnums to them.
 
Example:  massign Joseph 9000 9099
 
This will assign the vnum range from 9000 to 9099 for rooms to Joseph.
It is best to keep an areas object, room and mob range the same.
 
Be sure to always use 'checkvnums' to ensure the vnums you are going to
assign are clear.
 
See CHECKVNUMS, ZONES, NEWZONES, VNUMS
~

1001 RAT~
&YSyntax: rat vnum1 vnum2 command [parameters]
&G 
Rat, or 'range at' is the at command with the added parameters of two
room vnums.  Assuming the vnums are valid, your 'at' command will be
executed in every room in the range you give.
 
Example: rat 100 110 redit flags 0
This will clear the room flags in all rooms from 100 to 110 inclusive.
~

1001 RDELETE MDELETE ODELETE~
&YSyntax:  rdelete <vnum>
&YSyntax:  mdelete <vnum>
&YSyntax:  odelete <vnum>

~

1001 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK~
&YSyntax: reboot <nosave>
&YSyntax: shutdown <nosave>

&G
REBOOT shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of sixty seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level 101 may not log in.  Players who lose their links, however,
may reconnect.

If nosave is specified for reboot or shutdown, it will not automatically 
save all of the players.

1 REIMB REIMBURSEMENTS REIMBURSEMENT REIMBS~
&GReimbursement is basically getting things back that you lost due to PK, 
stupidness, forgetting to save, etc. etc.

&PThe following are causes we will NOT reimburse for&p:
&C-&c Someone Voodooing your corpse before taking things out of it.
&C-&c Loss of corpse due to corpse decay. "Help corpse" for details.
&C-&c Loss of corpse due to any sort of lag.
&C-&c Loss of corpse from problems with your computer or internet access.
&C-&c Items lost from not saving your character regularly.
&C-&c Giving an item to a friend, they don't save, mud crashes, item disappears.
&C-&c Containers lost because they were left on ground or destroyed by a mob.
&C-&c Items lost due to scrapping by mobs or other players
&C-&c Items lost due transferring equipment from one character to another.
&C-&c Items lost due to not saving after looting your corpse and a crash 
occurs.
&C-&c You delete your character over a any reason.
&C-&c Made items in engineering.

&PReasons we WILL reimburse for&p:
&C-&c You die, the mud crashes, you come back, and your corpse is gone.
&C-&c You log on as a newbie for NO apparent reason. Unless an IMM deleted you.

&GRemember, corpses save over reboot. For the weird freak chance that your
corpse doesn't, you most likely will be reimbed.. Unless someone picked it
up and took it.

For a reimbursement, ask a 1001 or higher. However, do NOT pester. By
pestering, you just annoy, and will make things take longer to get done.
As well, you don't "request" things that you didn't actually have, we can
find out if you're lying, and if you are, you lose everything.

1 RELATIONSHIP MARRIAGE DATING DATE WEDDING MARRY~
&G
Due to the timeless bitching to immortals about males wanting
divorces from female characters that don't log on due to being
harrassed by those same males, marriage has been upgraded. You
now have to **know** the person IC for a certain amount of
time until you propose or marry.


&BAskOut&b:
&G
This command is the basic command, the one used to start a relationship.  
To ask someone out, simply use the askout command.  This will put you both 
in a pre-dating state, and depending on their answer will either put you as
dating, or single again.

&BPropose&b:
&G
Once you've been dating for a total of 20 weeks, you may propose to your
partner.  This will take you to the second stage of the relationship
process.

&BMarry&b:
&GOnce you have been dating for 50 weeks, you may ask an immortal to marry
you.  This will obviously make you married.

&BBreakup&b:
&GIf you are still in the relationship/dating/proposal stage of your
relationship, you may breakup with your partner at any time, by simply 
using the breakup command.


&BDivorce&b:
&GOnce you are married, this is the only way out of the relationship.  You
must ask an immortal for a divorce, and it will be granted on very rare
circumstances.

&G
Relationships here aren't meant just to be brought upon so you can
mess around with xsocials, which is highly frowned upon here. We
prefer that it be more in depth, seeing as how its RP.

1001 REMBOUNTY~
&YSyntax: rembounty <name>
&G 
This allows you to remove a bounty of a player.
~

1001 RENUMBER~
&YSyntax renumber &b  [&Bflags&b]
Flags: fillgaps verbose
&pExample: renumber blah.are 9000 fillgaps verbose&w
&G
The renumber command renumbers an entire area to a new vnum base. All rooms,
objects and mobs will be renumbered, and all references to them will be fixed 
(changed to reflect the new vnum for each object/mob/room). These references 
include: resets, exits, shops, repair shops, and the objvals of some objects 
(containers and levers). 

Unless the "&pfillgaps&G" flag is supplied, the command doesn't fill vnum gaps. 
If you just want to fill the gaps in the area instead of changing the vnum 
base, simply supply the same vnum base (duh!). 

If the "&pverbose&G" flag is not supplied the command will simply report 
the actions. If it's supplied, it will also list all the vnum changes, and
report details on all the reference fixes.

The command will only modify references inside the area, except for two-way
exits leading into the area, wich will be listed if the "&pverbose&G" flag is
supplied (so that you know that you also have to save those areas). 

Mobprogs can also contain references to vnums, but since prog parsing is
far beyond this command, all it does is perform simple string searches and 
warn you if it finds any (possible) references, and it only does this if
the "verbose" flag is supplied. This search is performed only in the progs
inside this area, not in every mudprog in the game.

In conclusion, &Pall references are modified by the command except&G:
	&p* &Rresets in other areas for things being renumbered
	&p* &Rreferences to these vnums in mobprogs in other areas
	&p* &Rone-way entrances to the area

A prototype area can only be moved inside its vnum range, never out of it.
The vnum ranges for proto areas are not touched; the ones for normal areas
are changed to reflect the renumbering. Proto builders can only move their
own area.

Finaly, please bare in mind that there's no way to change hard-coded 
vnums except by changing code. So you'd be advised to &Rcheck the
code&G if you ever decide to renumber any of these areas: &Rlimbo.are,
gwomacademy.are, newacad.are&G.

another cannot do one until 6 hours has passed, regardless of whether or
not they have not done one that day.
 
A Greater God or higher can do a restore all whenever they wish, and are
not constrained by the above limitations.

0 RP~
&GRP means RolePlay, in which you place your character in a sit-
uation, and play it out as a story. Your character can meet
people, fight, sleep, just about anything they want in RolePlay.
You use the gmote channel to express your roleplay.
 
&RExample&r:
&C(&c-&zGmote&c-&C) &cKamorov fires Tallgeese's Dober Gun at the unidentified
mobile suit hoping to do signifigant damage
 
&GThat shows a simple attack, in which the other person would respond
to. If you're doing a solo-RP, you can play the part of the other person,
just be sensible. The leading cause of bad roleplays is the player trying
to be too intricate.

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from 
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

1 STORY~
&G
In the year After Colony 196, Zechs Marquise was succesful in dropping
the Battleship: Libra onto Earth, and thereby turned the Earth into a
baren wasteland.  However, White Fang's reign over space was short lived,
as the remnants of the Earth Sphere Unified Nation reformed on M02 and
independant colonies to oppose them.  Oz also reformed, seeming to oppose
any order which was not there own.  The Maganac Core split off from the
ESUN and created there own elite group of mercinaries.  Later on, the
refugees from the destroyed Earth took to Mars in a massive terraforming
project which brought about the creation of New Earth. Some of the cities
from the old earth have been reconstructed there, and most of the old
earths population have fled to it.  Those remaining on the old earth fell
into different clans, and wage war for pitiful reasons on one another.
And as for the Gundam Pilots, they all dissapeared into different parts of
the galaxy, humiliated and beaten, never wanting to show themselves again. 
 
The fate of the galaxy is in your hands, what will you do with the fate of
mankind?

1 STRENGTH STR~
&GStrength (STR in your 'score') represents your character's physical power.
 
The most common concern with strength deals with how much your character
can carry.  For each additional point of strength  you gain an additional
amount of maximum carryable weight.  Any character with 20 strength can
carry 500kgs.
 
Strength also affects (among other things):
 
 - damage roll and hitroll; for each additional point of strength, each
   of these will increase
 
 - chances of success for bash, stun, bashdoor, shove and drag, and the
   ability to dual-wield heavier weapons

corpse.

1 SUPERMOB~
&GThe following is a list of rules for the "Super Mobs."
 
#1: No sniping. Period.
#2: No attacking any player that has been involved with a supermob
    within the past 15 minutes. No exceptions. Do and expect to bleed.
#3: Don't abuse the 15-minute wait period, meaning don't pull stunts
    like attacking a mob every 10 minutes to avoid being PKed. You have
    a chance to run away from a player... You can be slain by an immortal
    from anywhere.
#4: Only the player who killed the supermob may wear the equipment. NO
    EXCEPTIONS.
#5: Don't complain about being killed by a supermob. They're not aggro,
    so they won't kill you if you don't bother them.
 
The following is a list of mobs, and what each drops:
 
    &RZ&re&pc&rh&Rs M&re&pr&zqu&pi&rs&Re&G - Epyon Helmet

the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

you will quite possibly slow things down instead of speeding them up by
setting it higher than that.

who's control it is under, along with the current respect the area holds
for the gang. 

The respect rating ranges from -100, to 200. If your gang owns the turf

of the area, otherwise it can be captured by a rival gang.

Areas with respect below 0, in the negative numbers can be captured.

1 TVIRUS T-VIRUS BLOOD~
&G
Created by scientists at the Umbrella Inc. This genetic virus will
spread through human cells, giving them a lust for blood. Upon death
the infected corpse will raise from beyond, looking for blood and
victims to attack. Being bit by an infected person, or by drinking from 
a contaminated drinking source will infect you with the T-Virus.

The corpses that raise from beyond, will be very weak, however their
durability is quite strong. As of yet, no cure has been found to handle
the deadly virus.

It is advised to drink from your own sources of liquid, and not to share.
Otherwise the virus will infect you, and the lust for blood will begin.
~

1 TWIT~
&G
If you pissed off an Immortal, then you may of recieved a TWIT flag. As a
Twit you can be PK'd by ANY player, even if you're pk, non pk, or the

&YSyntax: typo <message>
&G
This command will let you send a messege to the imm's about where a typo is.
Please use typo <line with the typo in it>. The room is automatically

1 UPGRADESUIT~
&YSyntax: Upgradesuit <suit> <upgrade> <value>
&G
Upgrade: firstweapon, secondweapon, thirdweapon, mod, alloy.
&G
&GUpgrading suits is a new process here. First you have to find the

amount of money, which will be told when you buy it.
&G
First, Second, and Third weapons atm can only be changed to
NON-Gundam weapons, and each cost $100,000. &CHELP WEAPONINDEX&G

Alloy is what your suit uses to defend itself. Iron, Steel, Titanium,
Neo-Titanium, Gundanium, and a new alloy known as Z-Gundanium, are the 
alloys that are used in Mobile Suit armor. The more durable the alloy,
the less damage you take from enemy attacks.

1 USE ACTIVATE~
&YSyntax : Use (item)
&G 
Quite obviously lets you use an item.
~

1001 USEPROG~
&YSyntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]
&G 
The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke
 
When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see 
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.
~

1001 USER~
~

1001 USERS~
&YSyntax: users <host ip>
&YSyntax: users <playername>
&G
USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.

Excerpt from the "Typo" submissions list:
 
&G[ 2029] Gallion: WOrkship Corridor.  &Ralot&G of them say this.
 
&BPeople who don't know that "alot" isn't a word shouldn't use
the "typo" command. Kthxbai.
 
&P=&BShinji: Starting sometime before 2:00 AM in the morning on 3/3/06,
proceeded to "suicide yes" 6,975 times... While absolutely no one was
paying any attention at all. G'bye, Shinji.
 
&P=&BGunther: Deleted and banned (for the 6th or so time) for evading
his ban (For the 20th time). After pleading to be allowed to play
and being told he'd had too many second chances already, he replied,
"this is like, my 6th chance." So long, Gunther.

1 WAR~
&G
Clans have the ability to war with each other. If one clan wars with another
clan, they may do the following:

&B1. Kill members of the clan that they are at war with
2. The war must last 24 hours
This is to prevent people from declaring war, taking planets or killing people
then declaring peace so the are safe and no one knows what happens.)
