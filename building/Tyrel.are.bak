There are flashing lights everywhere. People are rushing from every
direction to get to their ships. Tiny little repair droids are scurring
about trying to repair everything. There is a large blast door parting
space from the bay.  There are raised pads signaling the ships where to
land.

This is the space station's main shopping center. The amount of people
rushing about to buy stuff is unbelievable. This time there are shops set
up on the side of the road instead of little stands. A stray dog is
running around looking for stuff to nibble on, must be hungry. There are a
bunch of shopping bags just thrown about. People here must not be very
neat and tidy.

Trip Lane~
This is the street leading to the training area. Lots of people train in
that area, so there is trash everywhere. Light poles have been placed into
the ground, but look to be unused because of the artificial sun. There are
grunts and screams coming from up ahead, the training center. There are
large oak trees scattered about along the sidewalk, with squirrels running
about in them looking for acorns, kinda awkward.
