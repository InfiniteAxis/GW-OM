O'Hare Air and Spaceport, Air Terminal~
You are standing in the Airport terminal of Chicago's famous O'Hare
Airport. This terminal isn't used as much as the Spaceport terminal now
that psace travel has become so popular. There are still people running
around in a frenzy trying to make their flight on time, but not nearly as
many as you can see in the other terminal.

Air Terminal Hallway~
Near the Air Terminal, the crowd is thin, with few people rushing to their
flights. It's peaceful and quiet aside from the random crying child. Since
not many people use airplanes anymore the shops and restaurants here have
closed down. All around there are payphones and vending machines, with the
occasional virtual reality video game for bored children.

Space Terminal Hallway~
In this building, the crowd is noticeably bigger. There are so many people
trying to get through, that it's almost violent. The sounds of crying
children and yelling parents can be heard from every direction. The
vending machines, payphones and virtual reality massage parlors are still
every few paces, but you can smell real food cooking, so there must be a
restaurant nearby.

Air Terminal Hallway~
The crowd seems to thicken as people rush to catch their flights. Every few
paces, there are vending machines and payphones as well as virtual reality
booths that provide company for the lonely traveler. It's not very noisy
here, unless you count the odd sounds coming from inside these booths. 
Better not to ask....

Breezeway Between Terminals~
This is a nice patio area that separates the two terminals. There are
benches and trees and flowers here, with a fountain in the middle. It's
the perfect place to sit and relax and watch the airplanes and shuttles
come and go. It makes you forget all the pandemonium that's going on
inside.

Space Terminal Hallway~
Nearer to the Space Terminal, the crowd magically becomes so thick it's
hard to get trhough. There isn't a free payphone, vending machine or
virtual reality jaccuzzi to be seen anywhere. The smells of real cooked
food wafts from the restaurant and pub, and you see overpriced souvenirs
in the window of the little shop.

O'Hare Air and Spaceport, Space Terminal~
You are now standing in the hub of O'Hare. There are hundreds and hundreds
of people waiting to catch a flight to one of the Colonies, or even back
to Ruined Earth. You can see many ships lined up outside the huge,
plexiglass windows, being prepared for launch. Every once in a while, you
hear a disembodied voice announcing a flight.

Ching's Chinese Cuisine~
Following the delicious aromas that you could smell from the hallway, you
find yourself in a tiny Chinese restaurant. There is a small goldfish pond
with a fountain of Buddha in it as you walk in. The walls are crimson with
gold dragons and Chinese symbols all over them. The atmosphere is dark and
cozy and the waitresses are friendly and helpful.
Just mention the Menu to Ching. She'll be glad to help you.

Fine Gifts and More~
As soon as you enter, you realize that this is truly a gift shop.
Everything in the store is overpriced and useless. There are miniature
space shuttles for kids to play with strewn around, and small Chicago shot
glasses filling the shelves. Just about the only things that aren't over
priced, are the airsick pills...and they're out of stock.
Don't forget to ask Megan what she has in "Stock".

Red-eye Bar~
As you wander up the stairs in search of a good, strong drink, you find
yourself in the rattiest dive you could possibly imagine. Completely
opposite than the rest of O'Hare, the Red-eye Pub looks like it would be
more at home in a dark alley than a spaceport. There are stains on the
walls and cracks in the ceiling, and the barstools don't have any fabric
left on them. The drunk sitting in the corner is loudly singing 99 Bottles
of Beer on the Wall and sloshing his own beer onto the bar. This is just
the sort of place to lose your pre-flight jitters.

Footpath~
This is the path to the parking lot. There are many trees and flowers along
the path. Surprisingly, it's not crowded here, even though it seems to be
the only way to get from the parking lot to the buildings. The birds
chirping and the bees buzzing make this a very calm, serene place to be.
However, the crowds inside the terminals are visible through the windows.

Parking Lot~
There are cars everywhere. So many that you can't even see the end of the
lot. Many people rush by you on their way to get to their flight, hauling
screaming children and heavy baggage.

Hyatt~
This is the foyer of the grand Hyatt Hotel. There is a massive marble
fountain of two mermaids entwined on a rock in the middle of this
exquisite room. The chanadliers hanging from the ceiling cast a romantic
light upon everything, and there is a friendly looking clerk standing
behind the counter waiting to show you to your room.

Paradise Cove~
This is the most expensive room in the hotel. There is a waterbed, a
jaccuzzi and palm trees all over the room, giving it a Carribbean feel.
The ceiling has a mirror that reflects the light from the lone chandelier,
making the room slightly brighter than usual. For a more romantic
atmosphere, there are shell shaped candle holders all over the room, and
the sounds of the sea can be heard from speakers in the corners.
