M03 Refueling Station's Landing Pad~
This small little refueling station is home to several people of all walks
of life. They have come here to evade certain government faction's taxes
and regulations. There are few mobile suits here, since so many people 
are poor.

M03 Refueling Station - Intersection~
Pathways seem to be going in all 4 directions. People coming from the east
seem to be holding food, and, as you look closer, you can see a man
selling food items. A guard's station is to the west, where all people who
cause problems seem to be going. The vapor lights above make everything
plainly visible.

M03 Refueling Station - Intersection~
There's a light mist in the air, as the air conditioning of the colony
leaks water about, and it evaporates. There are two shops near here, to
the west, an armor shop. To the east, a weapon shop.

This is a small weapon shop located on M03. It's not much, but it does have
a few rare items that have been smuggled on the colony. It's a brightly
lit establishment, with gun racks on the walls, and a cheery owner at the
counter.
