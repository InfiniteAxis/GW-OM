As you pass beyond the hidden door you find yourself in an office of
unusual design. On one wall is a rack of weapons. In the far corner is a
small gym with worn equipment as if it has been used for a while. The most
peculiar thing about the office is the person standing in front of you.
Although his manner of greeting you is friendly. You realize that he is
more than he seems. As he greets you you notice he is A Bounty Hunter and
the weapons on the wall are the reminders of his proffession. Perhaps you
can learn a thing or two if you study under this man.
