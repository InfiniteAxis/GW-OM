Landing Pad of Colony X55~
Landing cradles are placed all along the main hanger area, and technicians
seem to be busily fixing ships landed in them. A technician's office is to
the south. A giant hatch is above you, with the stars and the sun visible.
Men and women walk east and west to go to the different zones. The upper
hatch opens and closes as ships and mobile suits land.

As you enter the East Zone, you can automatically see to the south that a
giant window shows the stars and the sun. Giant plate lights cover the
ceiling in this room, making it easy to see. Men and women walk to and
from the west and north, going to the Landing Pad or the East Zone
Hallways.

to the west seems to be selling items to be used in a factory. To the

Solid Snake's Hideout~
A long hallway seems to be leading to the north, with pictures of past war
legends. A picture of the Iness Hell X in action is the major one, shown
with its Mega Sniper Rifle and X-Sword. Also present are some pictures of
other suits, such as the Wing Zero Custom, which Snake had the liberty of
piloting once, long ago.

A desk sits in the center of the room, with a plush chair behind it, and a
computer on top of it. Empty coffee mugs and plates of food are at one
corner of it, and papers and building plans are at another.  A filing
cabinate is in another corner of the room, filled with past files. A
bookcase is in another corner, filled with different books. A water
dispenser and couch are in another area, and a tv is on a stand up near
the ceiling.

Master Bedroom~
A single window lights this room. A giant light, however, provides the
light that this room needs. A giant bed sits against the north wall, and
seems to be used often, as the sheets are ruffled up.  A dresser is
against another wall, filled with Snake's normal clothing. To the east is
Snake's master bathroom.
