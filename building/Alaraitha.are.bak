Fountain of Remembrance~
A fountain shrouded in a beautiful garden is framed by many shelves coverd
in photo albums and scrolls. Pictures adorn the furnishing and the walls,
striking recongnition to all who gaze upon the. The fountain itself looks
fragile as if it would shatter in the slightest breeze. It overflows
gently feeding the garden its life force. A small kitten laps happily at
the small puddle that flows forth.

Fountain of Past Lives~
A cold breeze flows through this room and whispers of pasts unknown.  The
fountain is chisled from a beautiful cold marble and stands mid-height
covering half of the room.  Entering the room, memories of times willfully
forgotten flow, yet strangely feel appropriate. The scents and aromas of
the past waft about, sending chills up the spine.  The cold floor only
travels east and west.

Fountain of Sacrifice~
Rusted chains lie upon the floor with dried blood bonding them in place. A
faint crimson glow emits from everywhere at once, with its source being
the fountain. Blood flowslike wine and coalesces in small puddles in the
brickwork surrounding it. Faint cries can be heard from each of the
darkened shadows. The air is dirty and still, nothing will ever disturb
this wretched place.

Fountain of Lost Dreams~
Entering the area, a feeling of failure becomes overpowering. In the rear
of the room is a fountain, covered by shadow, nearly forgotten.  The
wooden base shows signs of unfinished thoughts.  Lying scattered about the
remainder of the room are withering feathers, some having been burned,
while others just lie losing the fluff. The air is very foggy and thick,
making it harder to breath.

An Abandoned Warehouse~
Entering the derelect building, dust clouds form from the slightest of 
movements. Partially broken glass windows allow illumination to cast 
shadows igniting the imagination.  The scampering of rodents and other
unknown creatures can be heard coming randomly from the building.  What 
is left of the former contents of the warehouse lie in various states of
disarray.

Foreman's Office~
The clutter of this room glows slightly with the flickering light in the
center of the ceiling.  Piles and piles of old crumbling papers adorn the 
floor with a small path pushed through them.  An old chair sits weakly
behind a tattered and torn desk in the corner.  The door leans askew from
the lack of its upper hinge, which is lying in the thick layer of dust
over everything.

A Thick Forest~
The world around you shimmers lightly. Large, looming trees surround you in
all directions, preventing you from looking too far ahead.
