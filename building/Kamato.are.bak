Way to J19~
You are in your way to the entrance gates of J19. As you walk by you see
the tax paying area, might as well stop by. If your a colony resident you
have no need to, just show the card to the guard and he will tell you what
to do. Anyone who is not a resident of J19 must pay taxes. This allows for
a stability of the colony's economy and that way we can keep J19 in the
number 1 position. Thank you again for coming to J19.

J19 Entrance Gates~
You are now standing in front of a beatyfull golden medieval type gate.
There are quite a few people walking about but there is a scary looking
guard infront of the gate. He seems to be guarding it. Everyone is going
to him and he tells everyone where to go, might as well go to him as well.
If you don't have your ticket you might as well turn around and buy it.
This guards get ticked off very fast about that matter.

Ticket Sales~
Welcome to our land.If you are here it means you are not a citizen of our
colony, so let me be the first one to welcome you.You will find our colony
to be very well secured and neat.I love the place, and I am sure you will
also.In the colony there are all types of stores and locations, if your
lucky you might find an empty apartment and be able to buy a home here.
Make sure you check out every corner of this place, you will find it
compensating.The taxes depend on how long you will be staying in J19.

Old Ticket Sales~
As you go under the ropes at the door and walk into this place it looks
like a total mess. Broken wood and dust everywhere, cans and plastic
bottles on the floor. There's a small sign that says they closed this
store due to legal reasons. But as you walk further into the room you can
feel a slight resonance of sound as if people were still there, strange.

Secret Area~
You found the secrete spot. This is the old ticket sales people. They
believe that no one should pay to enter J19, so they will get you into the
colony for free or almost. As you look around you don't see much, a couple
of desks and some mean looking guys. You are the center of atention right
now. Try to ask around and find out how this thing works, good luck.

J19 Visitors Hotel~
Welcome to the visitors hotel in J19. This is the place where all the
visitors com to take naps. You will also find the regular traveler that
comes here to spend the night, but most of the people walking around are
just tourists. The hotel is free of charge and you can feel safe in here.
It doesn't look very fancy and there are many people walking about, the
place looks very busy.
 
&cYou may 'Save' and 'Quit' here.&W
