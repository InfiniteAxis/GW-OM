opposite the entrance, "&CActivate&z". The sphere is lit by a large white

The Elevator - Western Tower~
The Elevator is nothing more than a large, smooth titanium sphere. The
bottom of the sphere has been made flat, to allow easier standing, but
other than that, the rest remains completely round. There is a single
word, written in exquisite italics against the wall of the sphere
opposite the entrance, "&CActivate&z". The sphere is lit by a large white
light that shines down from the center of the top of the sphere.

A set of sheathes hang from the wall on a hook, but the swords appear to be
missing from them. A picture of a man-size turtle with a blue headband
rests on a shabby wooden table across from a well-made bed.

Raphael's Room~
A pair of sai are impaled into a nearby wooden desk, and a large radio sits

a Strange Alcove..~
A small alcove in the ground, accessible from a broken down wall in the

frightening man standing here, with metal all over his body.

The Lobby of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel~
A huge chandalier hangs about you in all of it's glory. It's made of almost
over a thousand diamonds. A large counter in the back of the lobby has
quite a few computers resting upon it, and the constant sound of an
elevator door opening and closing. On each side of the lobby are shops.
There is an atm machine in the corner of the room here, as well.

statues and souveniers to buy. Along the counter is a large statue of the

figurines.

The Ritz Cafe'~
The aroma of freshly ground coffee and hot chocolate permeates all around
you as though it were blanketing you in protection. A big hot-dog cooking
machine as well as a nacho cart sits near the coffee makers and tables
that line the walls. This room is very relaxing, and it seems as though
you'd recover quite easy in such an environment.

A large computer monitor rests on top of  the counter before you, with a
calculator  to it's side and a credit card swiper  just next to that. The
counter is made of marble  and a golden railing rims it, curving slightly
to  give it a circular look, although the  counter itself is actually
flat.

Theres a bed and a lamp along with other necessities  such as T.V. The
carpet is made of shag, and it's pink.  This could possibly be the "love
