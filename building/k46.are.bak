You stand on the Landing pad of K46. Engineers scurry about trying to repair
the damage to suits and keep the bay clear of debris. Perhaps it would be best
to get clear of here before you get in the way.

This is the Shining Cutlass, the premier Weapons dealership of K46. Which
may seem odd being that weapons are banned from non-military use here on
K46. But Obviously, Someone has connections within the local government.

this building. The janitor usually roams about the complex picking of

painted on both sides of the ships bow. A hole has been ripped in the hull
obviously from the impact with the colony.

For colliding with a Colony, The ship seems to be in perfect working condition,
well, if you take away the hole you just used to get inside. The Crew is 
still out moving around and going on as though they haven't collided with
anything at all.

This Hallway is kept in perfect order. Consoles along the walls provide
easy access to the ships computer, allowing easy crew access to enable alarms
that signal Intruders, and any other such thing that would need to be
told to the rest of the Crew.

A large ship has crashed into the side of K46, embedding itself so well in
the side of K46 that there is no atmosphere leakage. The air is still 
breatheable and it doesn't seem to want to suck you into space. You must
