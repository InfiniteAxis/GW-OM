Middle of a Frozen Wasteland~
There is nothing but a wide, desolate expanse of whiteness. As far as the
eye can see, only the swirling snow and the blurry peaks of mountains can
be seen. The wind howls like a wounded banshee and the harsh wind blows up
more snow like an unending blizzard. This is Antarctica.

A Frozen Wasteland~
Miles and miles of nothing but the frozen landscape stretches beyond the
horizon and further. The harsh winds blow ceaselessly and the howling
winds blow up snow, creating a maelstrom of white. This is the frozen
beauty of the North.

A Frozen Wasteland~
The howling winds sound like the screams of the dead as the snow is kicked
up into a fierce storm. There is nothing but the desolate desert of white
that stretches to the horizon and beyond.  Perhaps there is some animal
life that can be captured for food.

A Frozen Wasteland~
The landscape here is barren and desolate with nothing but oneself to keep
company. The winds are fierce and harsh as the snow is kicked up into the
air to add a biting chill to its already icy winds. The horizon is barely
discernable from the sky. One can only wonder where the sky ends and land
begins.

A Frozen Wasteland~
The swirling winds of white and grey are the only things that can be seen
besides several jagged mountains of snow; barely visible through the
impenetrable winds. There is a vast white spread out towards and beyond
the horizon. This is the cold desert of the North, where survival is
dependant upon instinct and skills.

A Frozen Wasteland~
The arctic tundra is unforgiving and unduly harsh; its winds the fiercest
and vicious. They are like beasts and those who dare to venture into this
dangerous landscape must be careful. One step in the wrong direction can
mean a certain Death. Take care to watch for any stray animals when you
need food. They will be the only source of food on this land.

A Frozen Wasteland~
The harsh winds of the arctic North are biting and savage; a lifeform of
their own. The blinding, bleak grey and white are the only things that can
be seen and there is no landmarks to help the traveler find their way. To
get lost in the Arctic to tempt Fate and Death. Be cautious and whatever
animals comes your way might be the only source of food.

A Frozen Wasteland~
This is the literal edge of the world where the barren landscape defines
the beauty of this land. Here is the only place where you can literally
travel all around the world in less than 1 minute. The winds blow
ceaselessly and with a brutality that makes one cold right to their very
soul.

Survival depends on one's skills and instincts here. Those who can
perservere in these extreme conditions are the only ones who will live
here. This is Nature's domain where it will overpower those who are not
strong.

A Frozen Wasteland~
The bitter cold winds claw and rip at the air and at the surroundings, as
if it will rip the land and the mountains to shreds with its cold, brutal
strength. The winds are like entities of their own, the masters of Nature
untamed and unconquerable by no man. Antarctica is the only place where
they can roam free with their rage.

A Frozen Wasteland~
A lonely, faint howl of an animal can be heard echoing through this lonely
landscape. There is nothing but snow and the faint outlines of mountains
somewhere in the distance. Food and water here are scarce, and not even
the best hunters dare venture out into this wasteland alone.

A Frozen Wasteland~
The sky here is not as bright as other places in the world; the skies are
constantly cloudy. Although there are lapses of tranquility, those are
very rare and usually lasts a day or so. The concept of time here is lost
because one can never how fast time travels here. Time is a variable.

No landmarks distinguish this monotonous, desolate land. There is no sign
of any civilization or human life here, but perhaps further exploration
might yield to a small Native village. However, there is no real sense of
direction here.

In the distance, you can see the large icebergs floating like hulking
masses in the frigid waters. You can see the marine life bobbing up and
down from here, some dare come to the edge of the precipice to risk
fishing there. If one is patient, perhaps a rogue seal can be killed for
food...

A Frozen Wasteland~
The land begins to roll gently upwards, but the harsh winds still continue.
The dark, ominous skies are always swirling with grey as the surface
beneath them gleams a blinding white in the absence of light. It is a
strange irony, yet befitting a desolate desert such as this.

The ground crackles dangerous beneath as the frothing, churning waters can
bring a swift death to those not careful. In the distance, the jagged
peaks of icebergs can be seen bobbing in the water. The luminous blue,
gray and white stand incandescent and hauntingly cold against the backdrop
of the equally gray skies.

Nearby, the water splashes against the edge of the icy shore, and the faint
cries of an animal at sea can be heard, floating on the wind. Strangely,
the winds here are less harsh than those inland. Rarely, the fins of a
whale can be seen emerging from the dark blue waters and then disappear
once more underneath. It is a beauty rarely appreciated, let alone seen.

The land looks like a desert prairie with its unendling flat surface
stretching for miles without an end. The glittering cold snow crunches
underneath each footstep and the winds blow harshly the further inland one
travels. Perhaps a landmark might be in sight soon. Hopefully.

A Frozen Wasteland~
The sky is cloudy and the usual ball of light known as the Sun is not
visible. This is the one place where the Sun cannot offer the warmth it
traditionally does. There is only the cold, harsh winds and the endless
white of snow.

Glittering expanse of snow stretches out beyond the horizon, the sky and
the ground becoming one in the distance. The winds here are calmer,
perhaps it is leading towards signs of civilization. There are tracks of
an undeterminable figure, perhaps human or not. There is only one way to
find out; keep going. Survival depends on determination and strength.
Mother Nature's fury is at its finest here in the cold hell of a desolate,
barren land.

Death is a bar that is too high for those who try to cheat it. Here, death
is the obstacle that stands in the way of survival. The winds blow colder
here from the shores, even in the distance the tips of the icebergs can be
seen. It is a truly beautiful sight to see during the setting of the sun.

The evidence of tracks can be seen in the soft snow underfoot. For such an
unforgiving land, the beauty that is hidden away from the eyes of the
world is truly rare and pure. Not even the loudest of screams can be heard
in the harsh winds that blow. Sometimes the land can be calm and tranquil,
but after the various events that had taken place here, it can also be the
harshest of places. Perhaps if one follows the tracks, something can be
found...
