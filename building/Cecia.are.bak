Sank Kingdom Public Airport~
A large white shimmering castle reaches up to the clouds as it blends with
the sun. Along the road to the north leading to this castle is a small
complex built into the hill with a few people walking about as they walk
back and forth between the castle and the hill. A plane lands as it glides
down the runway between the flashing lights and looking back out to the
west you see the sparkling ocean as the beams from the sun dance across
the rolling waves. A cold breeze blows in from the south as you notice a
mountain pass leading through the mountains down south but you are
distracted by some people talking and others traveling east down a small
dirt road to a small village and some other buildings. The grass and trees
sway with the wind giving you a sense of inner peace.

Along the Sparkling Ocean~
The ocean sparkles as the rays of sun dance off the waves and the cool
winds from over the ocean blow back at you cooling you from the hot rays
of the sun. The castle is closer now and you can see the people walking
back and forth as some people in uniforms patrol the area as they guard
something. The path you are walking on is hard, almost like metal but
different. A few light posts post are along the side of the path.

A Dirt Road~
The sun beating down on the side of your face as you walk down the dusty
dirt road. The wind makes a few small spirals in the dirt and makes the
grass slowly sway back and forth as the wind shifts directions. A few
people pass you walking clamly down the road enjoying the day, you can see
the town coming into veiw and the busy people in the town can be heard
better with every footstep.

On a Dirt Road just outside a Village~
As the dust clouds settle more by the town from the large buildings
breaking the wind you can now hear all the people chattering as they move
on with their busy lives. People walk up and down the street in front of
you and a few childern ride their bikes dinging little bells on the handle
bars. A few birds chirp in a tree on the south side of the road as they
are fed by their mother.

A cold rocky trail at the base of the two mountains that have been slowly
worn away over time by a small creek that runs under your feet through the
rocks. The wind blows through from the west from up upon the mountain
peeks. The name of this trail was made by the small town to the north that
was raided by outlaws that ran through this pass out to the desert to
escape capture and to hide.

&OThe ground is rocky and a few larger rocks sit to the east as parts of
them show out above the sand. They form a rather large circle that give
some protection from the windy desert, a small split in the rocks opens to
the east about two feet wide and less at some points.

A large kind of oval area with a large ring of stones in the center along
with two tents that have been pitched to the north and south of the fire.
A few bags and bones of things that have been eaten here lay on the
ground, most covered by sand. The wind howls over the top of the rocks and
kicks up sand when the angle is just right.
