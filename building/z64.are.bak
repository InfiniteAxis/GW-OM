The hotel receptionist stands here, checking in guests.

He seems ridiculously busy, checking guests in and out, trying desperately to
keep things going at a steady pace, despite the hustle and bustle about him.
Perhaps you should do your business with him and leave him to his own?

Box of .50 cal ammunition~
This is a box of .50 calibre shells. They have a short, brass jacket with a
hollow point tip. The box its self is made of red cardboard with a grey
cardboard excerpt. The shells are held in place by a piece of white
styrofoam.

A superb cut, thoroughly done. The smell overcomes you as you look examine
it. It's still very tender and juicy. You should consider giving your

The proprietors spared no expense here. This is a beautifully carved piece
of furniture, to which extremely close attention was paid every last detail.
Oddly enough, though, the drawers seem stuck... Most likely from abuse by
previous guests here.
