The Ghetto Landing Pad~
The area around this landing pad is pure rubble, as this isn't the richest
area around.  The wee children of the ghetto scatter about as they see
you, thinking you're some wierd white man.  To the west, you see a Mobile
Suit on cinder blocks, evidently being jacked by thugs.  To the east, you
see the Goodwill office, where people can buy good things at a cheap
price.

is no way of telling what there is to the northwest..

It's amazing to think of a high tech holographic machine in such a lowlife

install training devices to protect themselves from other crackheads.
Remember, one crackhead's trash is another one's way of toking up.

Road Before Radioshack~
This is a beat up old road where a lot of druggies like to hop people as
they walk to the store. There is a roll of duct tape lying out in the
middle of the road for no reason, maybe to try and catch some food..

Old Broken Down Radioshack~
This old store has been here a while, and makes a stable business from all
of the people coming in and buying radios, rims, and the like. The nerdy
little clerk stands there looking stupid, and awaits your purchase.  There
is also a Color T.V in the window pointing outside.

The Red Light District~
This large industrial area is lined with whores, and other smelly
tuna-esque creatures. There are factories, shops, and other smog producing
pieces of crap around this area. Try not to breathe the air, it's not
pretty.

The Red Light District~
Pimps, whores, and other decrepit creatures line the streets in vain
attempts to score some quick cash.  You hear the shout of, "GIMME MAH
MONEY, HO!" as a prostitute is pimpslapped by none other than her pimp.

Road to China-Town~
The city life fades from smog to rice patties as you enter near Chinatown. 
Migrant workers husk their fields trying to make a harvest, with a poster
saying "Long Schlong Tong was here".

Chinatown~
The chinese mafia runs these parts, and it wouldn't be smart to cross them.
They'll hang your by your ankles and beat you with noodles until they feel
like stopping. Besides that, this simple road continues through the city,
with people pushing carts and all that other ghetto crap.

Noodles 'R Us~
This used to be a noodle shop, where all the people flocked to buy ramen
noodles. Now, it's just a room abandon, with a lonely parrot sitting in
the middle of it.

A Factory~
This desolate little factory has seen its own share of driveby shootings
and killings in its short history. There is still visible cocaine residue
on the table, along with roaches all over.

Three Kingdoms Artifact Store~
This majestic place is a great store for collectors of the Three Kingdoms
period.  Many old time weapons are hung on the walls, making this place a
jolly good time for any kleptomaniac.

Welcome to Long Shlong Tong's, don't play a gong, wash your thong!  There
are several coin operated washers lined against the walls, with driers
right by them. The owner, Long Shlong Tong, has a large picture of himself
on the wall, with the words below it, "Big Schlong, little store!"

Recording Booth~
Ah, this is it, the booth where Mister T makes or breaks his poor victims. 
It looks like something out of the Rocky Horror Picture show, with cheetos
everywhere. As you look closer at Mister T, you see a tattoo on his right
arm, stating, "&CDeath Before Pringles&z."

they need to.  They can usually be seen clinging from the top of walls
trying to claim new victims.

one hit, and can poison if they hit right. Don't stick around too long, or
you won't live to tell what they look like.
