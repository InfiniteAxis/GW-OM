&BSpace Academy Main Entrance&W~
You look around in amazement as you find yourself in the entrance to a
rather large Space Academy. The walls gleam of shiny brand new metal and
you get the distinct feeling you're inside a tremendous ship. There is
much you need to learn in order to survive in this universe. Following the
paths in the Academy will give you that knowledge. To the East and West
are Hallways leading to other parts of the Academy. To the North is a
Classroom. Type North to go to the classroom. If you've already visited
the class or know how to move. Head East or West.
&YIf you know how to play, head upstairs to see Ms
Noin.

Flying is rather quite easy once you get used to it. But first you will
have to buy a suit. Once you have picked out a suit, Type "Allships",
it'll bring up a list of suits/ships you  can purchase. The ones with
prices beside them are buyable, the other ones with names belong to other
people. Once you have found the suit you want to buy, type "buyship <name
of  suit/ship>". But before you try and fly, go learn the skills "Mobile
Suits", "Navigation", "Ship Systems", and "Weapon Systems". After that, go
to your suit, and type "open <suit  name>", then "enter <suit name>". Once
inside, type "Launch", you may fail on your first few tries, but keep on
typing launch till you take off.

Once you are in space, you can move around. Moving may seem complicated at
first, but it really isn't. It is done by directing your suit towards 3
coordinates, <x>, <y>, and <z>. So if you type "course 100 100 100", it
would bring you towards those coordinates. To see if there is anything
worthwhile going to, type radar, and it will show you anything else in the
starsystem. To control the speed at which you're going, type "speed
<speed>", <speed> being the number you'd wish to go at. If you type "speed
0", it will bring your suit to a complete stop. Typing Status will show
you your current coordinates, as well as the coordinates  you're heading.
Pay special attention to your fuel, if it goes down to 0, you blow up!

If you would like to go to another starsystem, or somewhere in your same
starsystem faster. Use hyperspeed! To hyper you must designate where to,
and the coordinates in the system you  wish to hyper to. "Calculate
<starsystem> <x> <y> <z>", to see a list of starsystems you can hyper to,
type "calculate". Then just use normal coordinates. Not too hard! So to
hyper to  the Terra Starsystem, type "Calculate terra 100 100 100", or the
coordinates you prefer. once it says you have entered them correctly, type
hyper. And away you go. Now to land,  point your suit towards a colony
using course and calculate, just type radar to see the coordinates of a
Colony/Planet. Once you are close, it'll say "Proximity alert:
colonyname". Thats when you type "Land <colony/planet>"
