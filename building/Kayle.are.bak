Hanger Bay of MO-III~
The one thing you notice about this place as you climb out of your suit, is
the fact that it is in pristine condition, especially for something
supposedly that is a mine. Several people stand in the far corner of the
hanger and it appears  that they are wearing bands on their upper arms
that have the letters WF on them.

Corridor A-1~
This cramped hallway is home to the residencies of the miners of MO-III
and is not kept as clean as the rest of the satellite. The walls here seem
to have been repolished and the dust of the mines, has at least in some 
small way been attempted to be cleaned up. Small rooms line the hallway, 
and from the cramped conditions within them you decide it would be better
to not go in.

This short hallway looks much the same as the main corridor. White
plexisteel walls from ceiling to about knee high, where the walls are then
a pine wood with a coating to keep them from losing their marbled luster.
Two large transparisteel doors stand open to the north, leading into the
elevator.

Elevator~
This large elevator was recently cleaned. The carpet is freshly vaccuumed,
the steel doors shine with a fresh polish, and the redwood smells faintly
of a fresh forest morning. The control panel to the right of the doors, has
something posted above it on a plaque.

This cramped hallway is home to the residencies of the miners of MO-III
and is not kept as clean as the rest of the satellite. The walls here have
no luster, and the plexisteel is dull brown color from the dust of the mines.

Corridor A-4~
This cramped hallway is home to the residencies of the miners of MO-III
and is not kept as clean as the rest of the satellite. The walls here have
no luster, and the plexisteel is dull brown color from the dust of the mines.
Small rooms line the hallway, and from the cramped conditions within them you
decide it would be better to not go in.

Before the Mines~
This small room looks exactly like the ones upstairs, except what used to
be white Plexisteel is now a deep brown color from all the Dust, and where
there would be pine here, is all Plexisteel. The sounds of miners hard at

Entrance to the Mines~
The only thing to be seen here are roughly hewn tunnels and metal grated
catwalks leading through the massive mines.far to the south, you think you
can make out what looks like a refinery of some sort. All around you are
the sounds of miners hard at work, trying not to be beaten by the White
Fang Overseers.

The floor of this tunnel has collapsed beneath the catwalk leaving only the

The walls bear that same White Plexisteel and lack of pine footboards as the
entrance to the mines, while the ship docked here to carry the refined ore away
does not resemble any normal ore ship you've ever seen.

MO-III Medical Center~
This lavish medical center is equipped with all the best of everything. MRI
machines, CT Scanners, Everything. The White Fang spared no expense at
preparing this installation for their members.

White Fang Officers Quarters~
These lavish quarters are much better off than those of the lower members of
the militia group. Small computer terminals are set up on desks beside the
beds with egyptian cotton sheets. A trunk rests at the foot of the bed with
a rather secure looking lock holding it closed, and a bathroom can be seen
through a door in the southeast corner of the room.

Before the Command Deck~
This small lounge seems to be kept cleaner than the rest of the installation.
Several furnishings have been placed here, along with a vending machine that
reads "Officers Only." A large transparisteel door leads to the north, but 
unlike the two to the south for the elevator, this one is clased, and from the
looks of the keycard reader beside it, locked, securely.

MO-III Command and Control Station~
This is the Command Station for the entire satellite. From here, the Deck
Officer can give orders, and relay messages to the entire station. There
appear to be no transparisteel windows normally situated in the bridges of
ships, instead there are Holographic video projections of the surrounding
space displayed at the four stations visible from this spot.

MO-III Piloting and Manuevers Station~
This Station is completely the opposite of the other stations here. Two chairs
and six consols make up the Pilot and Co-Pilot sections of the station. Each 
station has three consols to monitor the different aspects of flight, the view
screens here show very little activity in the surrounding space.

allows for five people to fit here comfortably. The ship is currently docked

Lost Within Some Twisting Tunnels~
You seem to have fallen into some sort of labyrinth like tunnel system deep
within MO-III. Chilling echos fill your ears as if there are other people
down here too. How long have they been down here? Does anyone know? It looks
like someone has scribbled something on the wall.

Center of the Twisting Hallways~
This titanic chamber is filled with massive stalagtites and stalagmites the
sound of dripping water is almost constant and sounds vaguely like rain. The
a small underground river trickles past a small ladder leading up along the far
wall and fresh footsteps show that someone else has been here recently.
