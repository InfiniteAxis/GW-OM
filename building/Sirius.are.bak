A Tree Frog~
A Hip-Hoppity Tree Frog is jumping around!
~
An extremely energetic tree frog is stand...rather jumping here before you.
If you're one of the lucky few who can actually catch it before it jumps off 
you'll see that's it's just like any other tree frog.

trainer dirty man~
A Grungy Man ~
A Grungy Man with a ripped shirt stands here with a shovel.
~
A man with, simply put, a grungy look about him is who you are staring at. He
stands in front of you, leaning on a shovel for support, with his other hand on
his hip.  An elderly gentleman with a flannel shirt, you can tell he's seen his
fair share of time on this earth. Maybe if you ask him, he can teach you how to
DIG. Maybe he'll even lend you his SHOVEL. It can't hurt to ask, can it?

&gNewly Laid &zTop Soil~
The first thing you notice as you venture into this area is the fact that
the&g Newly Laid&z Top Soil is just that...new. Just as the north of you has
&gFreshly Cut&G Grass&z, you find that in this area there is nothing but new top
soil. This is another phenom that you really can't explain, so you decide to 
dimiss it as another act of nature due to the &OEvergreen&z. All around you
are dashing rabbits, squirrels collecting acorns and berries, and other small
wildlife creatures.

Yes, you've guessed it, you've stepped into a large &zMarsh&z. Bull Frogs and 
the sound of insects skipping over the muddy water are the sounds that fill
your ears. You may want to think about getting out of this before your feet
start to sink into the mud below you...

fall in it, where would you go? If you're here, you may as well make the best
of things. It seems like this &OQuick Sand&z would be a perfect place to try and
find things that are hidden under the ground. A shovel would be a handy 
instrument to help you DIG for things.

as if it had no human traffic in it what so ever. To the west there is a large 
&OEvergreen&z, but other than that, it's just the animals and yourself. You
quickly deduce that it must be the &OEvergreen&z that's sucking the nutrients
away from the grass, stunting it's growth.

You have found yourself in a &BM&bilitary &BC&bompound&z, hidden inside of the 
large &GEvergreen&z tree. It seems as if there is a second and third floor, 
and paths that lead off to your north, east and west. The &BC&borridors
&zseem simply enough, but can you really know what's in them, and if they're 
safe? Only one way to find out...

This is the beginning area of the &C2nd Floor&z of the &BM&bilitary &BC&bompound&z.
The only difference between the starting room of the &C2nd Floor&z to that of 
the &C1st Floor&z is that you can head down here. Your other choices are to take 
the long &BC&borridors&z to your east and west, take a short path north, or to climb
further up. Something else seems different about this floor...I wonder what it 
is. Continue to find out.

This leads you to a new space with the exact same walling, ceiling, and floor
as the last room you were in. Still weary of this new space, you wounder what 
this place is used for. Head east again and find out more.

than you once expected. Nothing's changed, at least, so your feeling of 
uneasiness settles a little more. Thankfully, there seems to be a change in 
direction if you head a bit further to your east.

northeast there is a &BC&borridor&z. In place of your uneasiness are feelings
of excitement due to this discovery. At this point, you can either choose to
take the new path, or head back.

If you take the southwest exit, you'll find yourself in the &BW&bestern &BC&borridor&z.

Is it even worth it to travel all the way down? Heading southeast may just be
a better idea. If you remember correctly, there was a northern pathway at the
begining of this &BC&bompound&z. Maybe taking this hallway will lead you back to it.

east, thankfully, is a bend in the southeast direction. In hopes of any
kind of change in the repetition, you decide to continue.

To your east...just another long hallway. Heading in either direction seems to

In this &BW&bestern &BC&borridor&z, it seems that you have found a new path in
which you can travel down. This path will take you to the northwest. Quickly
glancing that way it seems that it's exactly the same as the rest of the rooms
you've been in on this first floor. Heading northwest won't seem so bad, what's
the worst that can happen?

&C1st Floor&c - &BC&burved &BC&borridor~
Another bend in the &BC&borridor&z is found as you head out of your last room.
Your choices now are to head south, or to go northeast. No matter which way
you go, it seems that you'll just end up in the same type of place you just 
came from.

&C1st Floor&c - &BT&bop &BC&borridor~
Scanning east you look upon a distant hallway. The floor seems to curve up, 
suggesting that the ground underneath you isn't flat. You're not really sure
what that means, but you do know one thing: Your choices for exists are to your
east, and to your southwest. To your southwest there is a &BC&burved &BC&borridor&z,
and to your east is another...long pathway.

&C1st Floor&c - &BT&bop &BC&borridor~
Yet another room in the &BT&bop &BC&borridor&z that looks very unique to the last few
you were in. This building is growing more enigmatic as you go along. Side
rooms don't exist at all, making these &BC&borridors&z even more of a puzzle 
to why they are here.

&C1st Floor&c - &BT&bop &BC&borridor~
In this room you find yourself just west of the &BD&bividing &BC&borridor&z which
seperates the two long corridors. To both your east and west are the same, new
hallways (which ironically are getting old, aren't they). Travel either way.

&C2nd Floor&c - &BE&bastern &BC&borridor~
You step into a room along the &BE&bastern &BC&borridor&z of the &C2nd Floor&z and begin 
to doze off due to the monotony of the floors. You remember that the &GEvergreen
&zoutside shrunk in width as it reached the top, so these floors must be losing 
diameter. Looking to your east and west, you can vaguely make out the end of
the hallways. Continuing along either path will surely lead you to a band.

&C2nd Floor&c - &BW&bestern &BC&borridor~
Traveling along the &BW&bestern&z pathway on this floor leads you, again, to two
choices to continue along. To your east is the begining of the &C2nd Floor&z and to
your west is what seems like a bend. Dangerous things seem to be absent of this
place, so thinking twice about heading in either direction isn't needed.

&C2nd Floor&c - &BD&bividing &BC&borridor~
Just as the &C1st Floor&z had a &BD&bividing &BC&borridor&z, so does the &C2nd Floor&z.
To the south of you is the beginning of this floor, and to your east and 
west is the &BT&bop &BC&borridor&z of this floor. Towards the end of those corridors
you can vaguely make out curves in the pathway. Try and head down one.
