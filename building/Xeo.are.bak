Colony X01 Intersection~
Giant lights seem to light this whole area, yet very few seem to be around
the area. Ships can be seen landing to the south. To the northeast is the
Outer Slums, where the trash of the colony lives, to the northwest is the
residental area, where everyone  seems to live, and to the north there
seems to be shops.

Inner Colony ~
A giant sign hangs on top of a pole, and says 'Shopping District' in large
bold letters. People walk north and south, either carrying nothing or
newly bought items. Both adult and child alike seem to be having fun.

Outer Slums~
Right away you can tell this isn't exactly a friendly neighborhood. Spent
clips, beer bottles, and burned out joints can be seen all over the place.
Junkies move from one shadow to another, and a drug dealer can be seen
easily. Homeless people walk from one place to another, shoving along
boxes and shopping carts. The artificial sun barely shines on this place,
because it is so dark and gloomy.

seen having fun with their friends, with the artificial sun glowing down

Colony X01 Landing Pad~
Large landing platforms are up against the walls, with a few hanging from
the ceiling and hooked onto the wall itself. A huge decompression chamber
is on the ceiling, so when suits and ships come in for a landing, they are
decompressed in safely.  Giant tools are all over the place, and suit
repair stations are set up around the area, making minor repairs quick and
easy. Six giant lights illuminate this whole room, and the only outside
view is through the decompression chamber. To the north is an
intersection, which seems to lead to the rest of the colonies.

Training Area~
Unlike the residental area, the training area is darker, and the people
aren't as happy. Hardened fighters come here to train their combat skills,
and newbie fighters come as well. A medical center is to the east, for
those who get injured. To the south is the weapon repair center, where
damaged weapons can be repaired instead of destoryed. A hotel is to the
west. The training center itself is to the north .

Weapon Repair Center~
Older models of blasters and swords hang from the walls. In the back of the
room is a workbench with a tool chest close to it. A pegboard is on the
wall behind the workbench, and is covered with every kind of tool
imaginable. The shopkeeper/weapon's repair specialist is sitting behind
the workbench, repairing an old blaster and humming a tune while he works.
He looks up and smiles as you walk in, and then goes back to work.

Comfortable beds and couches take up most of the space in this small,
one-roomed hotel. A single tv is in the upper right corner, and looks like
it has never been turned on. A few people are here, napping, but for the
most part, the place is empty.
