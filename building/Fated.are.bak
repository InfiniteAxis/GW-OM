Stairs to the Courthouse~
Marble steps lead up to the glistening white facad of the courthouse walls.
 White french doors line the landing above, black marble framing it into
the wall. Chipped white marble tiles cover the courthouse, specks
glittering in the light.  Two bay windows protrude from the gleaming
surface above, their windows opening onto the second floor. In the center
of the stairs a large statue of the Courthouse's founder, Shinato Sangre,
stands tall and at attention, holding a gavel in one hand.

wood spindles sit along the edge of the stairs, holding a carved wood
handleguide, and seperating the stairs fr om the rest of the room.
Overhead lights inset into the ceiling spill downward, illuminating the
stairs, and the beige walls along them.  A black wrought iron hand-guide
sits four feet above the ground, curving upward to the landing above. On
the walls, portraits of immortals hang neatly, most covered in a thin
layer of chalky dust.  Small gold nameplates sit under them, reminding
mortals of the next reality.

Polished marble tiles cover the surface of the floor, their reflective
surfaces glistening in the lights of the lobby.  The white french doors
lead into the center of the room, where a black marble compass points
north in the center of the room. High above a domed ceiling cases a
painting of immense proportions, stars and planets glistening on its
smooth surface.  Around the edges of it spotlights illuminate its paint.
Stairwell's encompass the room both north and south, starting on the west,
and following the curved walls east, their ornate wood moldings gleaming
in the bright lights of the room. At the far end, near the entrance to the
courtroom, a security desk sits two security guards, one watching the room
as the other watches the security monitors.    &RA Courthouse terminal is
here for you to contact the sheriffs.  If you use this for anything else,
charges will be pressed.

The white marble facad becomes a dank blank concrete wall as it lowers to
the basement.  A few water stains purge the vapor barrier, emitting a
musty humid enviroment. In the background a soft drip drop echoes off the
walls, it's sound eminating from the halls.  Above a concrete ceiling
spans from one wall to another, a small opening cut to create room for the

An elaborate wooden desk rests in the center of the room here, its wooden
legs digging deep into the soft blue carpet. Behind the desk, a large book
case to match that of the desk, rests against the wall.  It's shelves
filled with books of all sorts, most relating to the law of the mud.
Directly behind the desk, an indent in the book case reveals a waist haigh
counter, filled with personal effects of the judge.  Above that, a picture
of Judge Shinato Sangre, current Judge and Sheriff of gundam.

Courtroom~
On the far wall, a large raised podium commands the room, two smaller
podiums on either side of it.  The podium's oaken surface finished with a
light glaze, reflects the light of the room.  On the two smaller podiums
leather seats are apparent over their edges. Over the lip of the larger
podium, the headrest of a large plush leather chair and a gavel are
visible.  Along the northern wall, a few feet seperate of the podiums, a
wooden box sits, twelve chairs filling its interiour. Leading from the
western edge of the Jurer's box, a fence waist high heads to the south
wall, segregating the spectators. Infront of the fence, two large tables
sit on either side of the gate.  Two chairs resting behind the tables,
cushions on each. A walkway leads down the center of the room from the
entrance to the Judge's podium, a small gate opening the fence in the
center of the room. Rows of pews extend from the wooden fence, back to the
back wall, above a balcony to watch the proceedings as well holds rows of
pews.

walls. The moans of imprisoned echo along with the dripping, their
complaints of the conditions filling the air.

Administration Hallway~
Overhead soft lamps light the way, their glowing orbs inset into the
ceiling.  Along the walls soft carved wooden benches sit, their molded
seats beckoning to sit. The elaborate decor of the main level of the
Courthouse melds into the simple and humble decorating of the
administrative hallway.  A soft tan paint covers the walls, its glossy
surface reflecting the lamps.

Sheriff's Office~
The humble surroundings of the sheriffs office envelope the room.  A desk
sits in the center of the office, covered with papers from mortals. 
Behind the desk a large book shelf spans across the back wall.  It's
spacious shelves filled with books and personal effects of the sherriff.

The Landing Pad of Colony Z28~
You arrive at the Colony Z28 Landing Zone.  Ships from around the universe
are parked here in neat rows. A low roar echoes off the metallic walls of
a nearby apartment building.  A little boy runs by trying to sell his
newspapers.
