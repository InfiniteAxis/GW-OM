Middle of a Frozen Wasteland~
There is nothing but a wide, desolate expanse of whiteness. As far as the
eye can see, only the swirling snow and the blurry peaks of mountains can
be seen. The wind howls like a wounded banshee and the harsh wind blows up
more snow like an unending blizzard. This is Antarctica.

Miles and miles of nothing but the frozen landscape stretches beyond the
horizon and further. The harsh winds blow ceaselessly and the howling
winds blow up snow, creating a maelstrom of white. This is the frozen

that stretches to the horizon and beyond.  Perhaps there is some animal
life that can be captured for food.

A Frozen Wasteland~
The landscape here is barren and desolate with nothing but oneself to keep
company. The winds are fierce and harsh as the snow is kicked up into the
air to add a biting chill to its already icy winds. The horizon is barely
discernable from the sky. One can only wonder where the sky ends and land
begins.

A Frozen Wasteland~
The swirling winds of white and grey are the only things that can be seen
besides several jagged mountains of snow; barely visible through the
impenetrable winds. There is a vast white spread out towards and beyond
the horizon. This is the cold desert of the North, where survival is
dependant upon instinct and skills.

A Frozen Wasteland~
The arctic tundra is unforgiving and unduly harsh; its winds the fiercest
and vicious. They are like beasts and those who dare to venture into this
dangerous landscape must be careful. One step in the wrong direction can
mean a certain Death. Take care to watch for any stray animals when you
need food. They will be the only source of food on this land.

The harsh winds of the arctic North are biting and savage; a lifeform of
their own. The blinding, bleak grey and white are the only things that can
be seen and there is no landmarks to help the traveler find their way. To
get lost in the Arctic to tempt Fate and Death. Be cautious and whatever
animals comes your way might be the only source of food.

A Frozen Wasteland~
This is the literal edge of the world where the barren landscape defines
the beauty of this land. Here is the only place where you can literally
travel all around the world in less than 1 minute. The winds blow
ceaselessly and with a brutality that makes one cold right to their very
soul.

A Frozen Wasteland~
The bitter cold winds claw and rip at the air and at the surroundings, as
if it will rip the land and the mountains to shreds with its cold, brutal
strength. The winds are like entities of their own, the masters of Nature
untamed and unconquerable by no man. Antarctica is the only place where
they can roam free with their rage.

A lonely, faint howl of an animal can be heard echoing through this lonely

somewhere in the distance. Food and water here are scarce, and not even
the best hunters dare venture out into this wasteland alone.

The sky here is not as bright as other places in the world; the skies are
constantly cloudy. Although there are lapses of tranquility, those are
very rare and usually lasts a day or so. The concept of time here is lost
because one can never how fast time travels here. Time is a variable.

No landmarks distinguish this monotonous, desolate land. There is no sign

masses in the frigid waters. You can see the marine life bobbing up and
down from here, some dare come to the edge of the precipice to risk
fishing there. If one is patient, perhaps a rogue seal can be killed for
food...

A Frozen Wasteland~
The land begins to roll gently upwards, but the harsh winds still continue.
The dark, ominous skies are always swirling with grey as the surface
beneath them gleams a blinding white in the absence of light. It is a
strange irony, yet befitting a desolate desert such as this.

The ground crackles dangerous beneath as the frothing, churning waters can
bring a swift death to those not careful. In the distance, the jagged
peaks of icebergs can be seen bobbing in the water. The luminous blue,
gray and white stand incandescent and hauntingly cold against the backdrop
of the equally gray skies.

Nearby, the water splashes against the edge of the icy shore, and the faint
cries of an animal at sea can be heard, floating on the wind. Strangely,
the winds here are less harsh than those inland. Rarely, the fins of a
whale can be seen emerging from the dark blue waters and then disappear
once more underneath. It is a beauty rarely appreciated, let alone seen.

Glittering expanse of snow stretches out beyond the horizon, the sky and
the ground becoming one in the distance. The winds here are calmer,
perhaps it is leading towards signs of civilization. There are tracks of
an undeterminable figure, perhaps human or not. There is only one way to
find out; keep going. Survival depends on determination and strength.
Mother Nature's fury is at its finest here in the cold hell of a desolate,
barren land.

The evidence of tracks can be seen in the soft snow underfoot. For such an
unforgiving land, the beauty that is hidden away from the eyes of the
world is truly rare and pure. Not even the loudest of screams can be heard
in the harsh winds that blow. Sometimes the land can be calm and tranquil,
but after the various events that had taken place here, it can also be the
harshest of places. Perhaps if one follows the tracks, something can be
found...

The winds continuously smash at the hills of snow, the barren lands seem

sound like those of a widow, screaming for something.  The snow is thick
and soft, like cold honey but can numb a man to the bone. Death is a

well-worn, and even paw marks can be seen. It smells a bit musty in here,
the rock is rough to the touch. Perhaps going forward will bring sight of

is a wolf here, and by the looks of it, this wolf is the one who had left
the bloody trail here. Nearby the wolf, you can see a stone tablet with
etching in it. Perhaps that might be a key to finding the village.

A wooden sign that says "&RTo N'lgatha&z" is nailed onto a post that is

ice, so growing vegetation here is next to impossible. How do the natives

soft snow. The flat plateau that the village is built on offers a perfect
view of the barren, yet hauntingly beautiful landscape of Antarctica. In
its barren emptiness, a chilling beauty can be seen in this land.
N'lgatha's location also offers a perfect view of the icebergs in the cold
waters, and the grey skies above.

Entrance to N'lgatha~
Welcome to N'lgatha, the only sign of civilization in Antarctica. The
villagers are natives here and are very friendly to travelers and
wanderers alike. The city is made of wood, specifically logs. Where they
found wood is a mystery. Maybe there is something that is hidden away...

shops that sell various items and to the west is the clinic where the
wounded are sent to be healed by the town's doctor.

keycards to give people access to the facilities. A soldier walks by at
irregular intervals, not really paying attention to what's really around

Sniping Range~
The sniping range here gives the soldiers a chance to work on their aim and
shooting skills. There are three booths that have targets for people to
use. The targets reload themselves after they have been used.

Mess Hall~
There is loud noise and raucous laughtere here. This is where the soldiers
come to relax, eat and talk to others that they normally would not see
here. Off-duty soldiers normally gather here or in the barracks. To get
something to eat, talk to the on-duty mess hall soldier.

Barrack A~
The room is lined with narrow cots on both sides, blankets neatly folded up
at the foot of each cot. A large chest was at the far end of the room,
most likely for storing jackets or clothes. The lighting here is softer
than the harsh flourescent outside, and is generally quiter.

A Dimly Lit Corridor~
The dim corridor is not as bright as the others, but is still very clean
and sterile looking. For some odd reason, no one ever bothered to fix the
light fixtures here. The corridor continues north and becomes darker...

A Dimly Lit Corridor~
Yet another &Ysecurity panel&z is here against a steel door. What lies
beyond that door is a mystery. The walls are grey and plain, but shows
signs of wear and age. This base has survived many disasters and natural
impacts because of its location beneath the surface of the Earth, now
ruined and barren.

An Open Room~
This is the entrance to the training area. Soldiers use this place to test
each other's skills. There are three stories of room. You can climb up and
down to each level. There will be random soldiers that will attack you
depending on which level you select.

A Dimly Lit Corridor~
The corridor continues further north from here. There is a doorway to the
east that leads to a lab. It is a mystery as to why a lab would be
installed in a dark, isolated part of the base. There is no illegal
research going on within this facility...right?

A Dimly Lit Corridor~
The &Ysecurity panel&z here seems a bit different than the others. This is
also the end of this corridor. A young soldier is standing at attention in
front of this door. The walls here are smoother than the rest of the
corridor.

A Lab~
The walls are a pristine, blinding white and even the air smells and feels
sterile. This is one of the many labs within the facilities, but a less
used one than the others here. There are a few scientists in the room that
are hunched over their microscopes and quickly jotting down or sketching
whatever they are seeing. There are computer screens everywhere
haphazardly displaying endless data.

An Office~
This office is furnished airily and comfortably. The colonel on the base is
Ishida Shigeru, a cold, ruthless man that loves fighting and battles.
However, he is a family man and knows his limits. The walls are plain
white, but has several items hanging on them. There is a display case for
a pair of gloves, several pictures and a cabinet full of awards and
medals.  &RWhatever he asks, just say "yes".&z
