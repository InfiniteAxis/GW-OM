Catherine is standing here ready to welcome everyone that leaves a shuttle
to Colony P-VII. As you look closer at her you realize that she is about
in her mid-twenties and 5'7" with brown flowing hair down to her breast
line. You also realize that she is one that is easily recognizable from the
group of engineers that surround her daily.

Laura is standing behind the reception table ready to greet and help
anyone that arrives at Bio-Tech Industries. She is wearing the standard
uniform for Bio-Tech Industries which includes a fashionable blue shirt
with Bio-Tech Industries' logo and a nice pair of black pants. When
taking a closer look, you can notice that she is in her early thirties
and is weathered from many long days on the job. You also notice that
she has a slightly afraid look on her face and that she is constantly
looking at the guards stationed here.
