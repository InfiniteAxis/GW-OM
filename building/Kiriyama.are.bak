Multicolored lights shine down on the stage changing from one color to the
next.  The colors vary from warm to cool in the sequence of red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, then purple. The stage is constructed of reinforced
plywood painted black to give that vintage venue feel to it, well that and
because the dirt doesn't show as much. There are two monitor speakers at
the front of the stage and two other, rather large, speakers on each side
of the stage. A large banner in the back reads "Irony of Dying on Your
Birthday"

section on the wall has been painted white and filled with the performer's
autographs from the well-known, to the local high school band.

Oceanside High Hallway~
The hardwood floors have been buffed so well that reflections can be seen
in them. The fibers of the wood can still be seen giving the "real wood"
look. The walls are plastered with student government posters. Behind the
posters though, the wall is painted a soft yellow. Lockers line both sides
of the hallway and the flourescent lights seem to all be working.

The Pirate Cafe~
The sound of the cash register ringing up items and of the dropping pans in
the kitchen area fills the room. The scent of cooking food, whatever it
was on this particular day filled the air. The wooden floor has been
replaced with an adobe-colored faux brick floor. Refrigerators are lined
up one next to the other containing perishable food, and cold drinks. A
cappuccino maker is here for the students to load up on caffeine before
they go to their next class.

Mission Avenue~
History states that an old mission was built here but was torn down by an
earthquake. The road is named after that mission. Now graffiti covers the
walls here and gangs run rampant. This has become more of a passing street
than anything else.

Corner of Mission and Creation~
Graffiti seems to fade away here and nothing seems to be happening, nothing
of interest anyway. Tumbleweeds float by and a swirling wind can be seen
in the distance. A sign that is barely legible reads "Creation Way" and
another that seems to have been stolen.

Creation Way~
A desolate breeze can be felt coming from the ocean. This breeze is
different from other breezes in that it is still warm. The streets have
not been resealed in what looks like years. The pavement is cracked and
filled with potholes. The road actually looks more like a dirt road than
anytthing else.

Sweat and blood soak the foam, blue mat here.  Weights are suspended on

mirror takes up the whole east side of the wall and a water fountain can
be found to the west. The clanking of the dead weights hitting each other

The VIP area, where champagne is top quality  and the girls are nothing but
fine. All the real people that can be considered people, hang out here
when they don't want to mingle with the commoners.  Now, the Star Club
only allows the beautiful people in, but the VIP area only lets in the
beautiful people among the beautiful people, unless of course you're
really powerful.

Water or what one would hope to be water but is really  raw sewage streams
down here in its pure filth. Red eyes can be seen and a few skeletons
against the walls. Every drain eventually leads into this area and then
out to the ocean.

A Homeless Community~
Alcohol and dirt is what this place smells like. A fire is burning here in
a barrel and a few makeshift tents are pitched all around this end of the
tunnel. Nudie magazines and empty bottles of vodka, rum, and whiskey have
been broken against the wall.

The rumbling of mobile suits and other ships can be heard and felt through
the windows of the airport. People are busy checking in for their flights,
others paying to prepare their ship or suit for launch. Images of possible
destinations can be seen on the monitor above.

The heat from the many thrusters exploding can be felt already. The exhaust
fumes can be smelled everytime a person walks through the door. The

Oceanside Docking Station~
Balls are floating around performing maintenance on mobile suits here. The
sparks fly as armor is reapplied and long hoses connect to refuel the
gargantuan machines. Other suits can be seen departing and the fumes of
the suits launching can cause one to become quite  light-headed.

Underwater~
&GEverything looks green here, perhaps its due to the raw sewage that this
area is underneath.  Skeletons can be found at the bottom and one would
think not to stay here for very long.

The Beach~
White sand mingles with the salt-water from the ocean. The sun can be seen
just over the horizon and pieces of driftwood and washed up kelp scatter
the land. The smell of the ocean can fill one's nostrils and bring a sense
of peace. A lighthouse can be seen in the distance to warn ships who are
coming too close the shore.

Looking more like a basketball court than anything else. This place has
been known to put on plays on their stage,  basketball games on their
court, and provide daycare to parents on the go. The room is always kept
air conditioned except on the coldest of days.
