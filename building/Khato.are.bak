A Deserted Landing Bay~
The landing pad seems to be literally situated in the middle of nowhere.
There is grass and vegetation up to your knees as nobody seems to bother
trimming it in order to keep this place looking clean. The only signs of
civilization is some smoke in the distance. There is a barely visible path
leading towards the north.

A Dusty Trail~
Now walking on the trail, it seems to lead straight up ahead with no bends
or twists of any kind. There are wide open fields in each direction with
nothing but the horizon visible. The only paths lead north towards what
seems to be a large forest and south back to the landing pad.

Standing in the middle of the clearing, the main thing catching your eye is
the huge tree. The main trail continues towards the northeast and looks to
be rather more populated as there are many more footprints in the dirt.

Path Outside a Small Town~
As the path winds around a group of trees, a small town becomes clearly
visible to the north. The trail is becoming more of a road now and it is
no longer a chore to wander through the dirt. Trees seem to enclose the
town from all sides which makes it rather hidden for visitors. Perhaps the
local townspeople dont like to be disturbed.

Before a Small Town~
Nearing the small town, you can make out a bit of comotion and life in what
had seemed to be an empty and desolate place. The path is well worn out
from travel and the rusty town gates dont offer much protection from those
that would seek to harm these people. They seem to live in peace and
well-being.

Main Street~
This is the town's only street and it seems to cut clear across the small
village. There are houses on either side and small alleyways leading off
in different directions. The town consists of only the basic necesities
which are all found right around main street. Maybe the locals will have
more information on why this place is so deserted.

In a Dark Alleyway~
The dark alley is situated in between a row of houses in such a way that
their roofs block off most of the sunlight allowing this place to be
rather hidden at all times of the day. There is a musky smell in the air
which seems to be eminating from the various garbage cans scattered around
the alley in a neglective fashion.

Heading Towards a Bank~
As indicated by what seems to be the only advertisements in the village,
this walkway leads towards the local bank. There is some scattered change
on the floor that people have dropped as they pass through. The locals
must not value money highly as it seems nobody is bothering to pick up the
various coins.

Inside Of Local Bank~
The atmosphere inside the bank is very professional and quite different
from the of the rest of the town. The tellers are wearing formal wear and
the clients are all patiently waiting in line to be served. There is only
two operating bank tellers as the third seems to be out to lunch so the
process is taking a little longer than usual, but nobody seems displeased
or angry by the increased wait time.

The Local Merchant~
This is a small shack with all sorts of goods scattered around three large
tables which each lie against one wall with a small gap in the centre of
the room being the only place where you can move around. Most of the stuff
is junk, but perhaps something of value could be found among the piles.
The salesperson is a middle-aged man with a tiresome expression on his
face sitting behind a cash register placed on the side of one of the
tables.

Before the Aerenian Cathedral~
Before you stands a building that doesn't look very impressive in size.
What it lacks in apparent size, it makes up for in its architecture. The
front door is a huge gold rimmed arch way, with atleast fifteen feet tall
double doors. A narrow purple velvet carpet flows from the bottom of the
doors to the outside of the building, giving the building a welcome feel.
Extremely intricate religious depictions are carved into the wood of the
large double doors.

The Foyer of the Aerenian Cathedral~
The floor, walls, and ceiling are made of white stone bricks which have
been sanded and glossed into a very smooth surface. To the north is an
archway leading to the central cathedral area. To the east and west are
hallways leading into other sections of the building. The center of the
floor is covered by a carpet with swirling shades of purple, red, orange,
and yellow.

A Hallway in the Aerenian Cathedral~
Every brick on the wall has been polished clean so that not even a speck of
dirt can be seen. A narrow window to the south lets in a stream of cool,
blue light. Torches mounted on the walls illuminate the hall with a warm
and welcoming glow. A scarlet carpet covers the center of the hall,
muffling the sounds of footsteps.

Aerenian Altar~
Here stands a statue carved from a single piece of black marble with blue
streaks. It is in the shape of an odd creature standing on a pedestal.
This stone being has the body of a beautiful woman with leathery wings
stretching from her back. She is wearing a loosely hanging robe that hints
at an athletically shaped body underneath. She is staring up into the
heavens with her wings spread wide and her arms held out as if preparing
to embrace something. Two lines of dark red tears of blood stream from her
eyes down her face and onto her body. The tears are actual liquid, and are
not part of the granite sculpture. As they hit the floor, they flow into
the cracks of a tile.

Mella's General Store~
This is a small shack with all sorts of goods scattered around three large
tables which each lie against one wall with a small gap in the centre of
the room being the only place where you can move around. Most of the stuff
is junk, but perhaps something of value could be found among the piles.
The salesperson is a middle-aged man with a tiresome expression on his
face sitting behind a cash register placed on the side of one of the
tables.
