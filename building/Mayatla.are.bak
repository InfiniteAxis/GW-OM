Landing Pad of New Milwaukee~
Like the rest of New Milwaukee, the Landing Pad is a technological marvel.
Consisting of a platform held up by a series of arches extending from the
criss-crossing tubes below it, which sits at the pinnacle of the city. It
allows the visitors to gaze at the entirety of the city, the only
protection from the winds at an altitude a layer of transparent shielding.

Upon passing the landing pad, the only thing that would hold onlookers and
visi is a bar of metal.  Bendable, flexible, as well as sturdy, but also
seeming to keep the foundation of this city whole and sturdy.

Corridor One, Section One~
Walking forward through the tubes that make travel in New Milwaukee
possible, you find that it is almost identical to the rest of the place. 
Over looking the city, you see many tall buildings extend from the grown,
as the main way of travel stretches its massive hand to the horizon.

Corridor One, Section One~
Only a true citizen of New Milwaukee would be able to navigate the tubes
that make up the way of transportation here.  Arriving at the
intersection, the tubes seem to section off, going in every direction but
two, leading to more buildings as well as other tubes.  The horizon is
still clear, giving the city an almost nostalgic look.

Leaving the apparent intersection is a one way tube, which stretches far
ahead into more parts of the city.  Even though it is transparent, it is
steady, and created by the most exhalted of scientists, it is able to
uphold any weight that puts pressure on this vast traveling system.

before, equipped with the latest technology, but still bears the

stability.

This is the sanctuary for all anime fans.  A large couch rests in the
middle of the room, facing towards a large, plasma screen tv.  Free snacks
and goodies are set aside for those who wish to view the current anime
playing.  The tv is followed by a series of electonics.  A VCR, DVD
player, all well equipped with surround sound to give it a theater type
effect.  Various game units are also installed, giving the club members a
chance to test out their favorite video games in Japanese.  This place is
what most of the residents call, Anime Heaven.

Customers fill this part of the store with their items in hand, ready to
leave this place with their most prized possessions.  This part of the
store leads towards another tube, which is covered by a door and a small
walkway which heads towards New Milwaukee's traveling system.

Corridor Two, Section One~
This is the part of the town where the passage way cuts off, which leads to
an almost surreal section of New Milwaukee.  Almost as if it were written
out of a fairytale, the cobblestone path and forrest green grass, with any
flowers in creation are seen from this view, which New Milwaukee is famous
for.

Entrance to Armitage Drive~
Cobblestones mark the path to the entrance of the beatiful homes that
occupy New Milwaukee.  Being that it is freshly built, only a selected few
are granted the ability to dwell in this prototype city.  Even though it
doesn't resemble the old, the air of it is still around, making it feel
just like home.

Armitage Drive~
As the path continues, the beautiful homes tower before anyone who'd wish
to stand near.  The fresh scent of sod fills the air, as well as the scent
of gerber lillies, roses, and other various flowers. It looks like a
fairytale, and at the most, it looks like home.

At the end of the path, it seems to lead to the biggest home present here
in New Milwaukee.  Standing tall and proud, surrounded by a chain-linked
fence, with a few rose shrubs added as decor.
