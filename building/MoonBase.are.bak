say Hello there, $n. I don't know how you got here, but you should leave.
say This place, Omega Lab, was supposed to be a lab to experiment on mutants.
say We screw up however, big time.
say We were doing fine until an mutant named Tyrael came along.
say Tyrael got out of hand once we were through with him.
say Hell, he's so damn powerful now that even Scythe can't kill him.
say Feel free to wander if you must, but don't go too far.
