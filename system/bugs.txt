Viktoria: stands on the edge of the pool, her back to it, and backflips in, hitting the water with a graceful slice.
Skaara: chuckles and dives in with no grace, hitting the water flag and sinking like a rock.
Viktoria: sinks down above you and stands on you once you get to the bottom.
Skaara: lays on the bottom, until he can't breathe anymore. Slowly he brings his hand up to your ankle, and starts tickling the bottoms of your toes.
Viktoria: squirms and wiggles, trying to get away while trying not to laugh, her eyes really wide. She starts to kick a bit in attempts to surface.
Skaara: exhales all the air from his body from being kicked, and has to roll over and push himself toward the surface, letting go of your foot.
Viktoria: surfaces with a stutter and gasps for air, thrashing above and treading water until she regains her breath, "Ya lil' turd!!"
Skaara: surfaces behind you, spitting out a mouth full of water and chuckling lightly, "You asked for it." Grinning evilly he grabs your waist and pulls you down, dragging you back under the water.
Viktoria: screams before she goes under and gets one large breath of air, squirming all the way down and turning to look at you with an brooding evil look.
Skaara: grins again, letting some of the air in his mouth escape. His hands glide up from your waist, tickling their way up your body slowly.
Viktoria: squirms in your hold and shuts her eyes tightly, holding onto her air bubble with all her might.
Skaara: swims up to the surface, pulling you with him.
Viktoria: holds her breath as long as possible and exhales just as the surface is broken, "You're gonna kill us, doll. I swear ya are."
Skaara: snickers and grins again, "Of course I will. But you live for the danger." he says in a deep low taunting voice as he pulls you closer.
Viktoria: waves her hand about nonchalantly, "Oh yes of course, of course. Then again, one only knows danger when dealing with the likes of you, Sir." She winks and wraps her arms tightly about your neck, her fingertips playing in your wet hair.
Skaara: spins you around pushing you back against the edge of the pool and kisses you deeply, the buckle of his belt unclipping itself against the belt-strap on your pants.
Viktoria: returns the kiss and deepens it further, her tongue slipping across your lips teasingly. She leans into the edge of the pool and slips her hands down your back to tuck them firmly in your back pockets for now.
Skaara: slides his hands back down to your hips, his tongue chasing yours back into your mouth.
Joseph: pokes you in the belly button pilsbury style.
Dalamar: sits down and writes the date and the number 0 in a book.
Viktoria: tugs gently on your pants, the weight of the water in them helping them to slip off without even unzipping them. She glances twixt us as the pants float to the bottom, "Hope you weren't too attached to those?"
Skaara: shakes his head slightly and tilts his head to the side, watching his pants sink to the bottom of the pool.
Viktoria: watches the pants settle to the bottom, then looks up at you most innocently, a sweet endearing smile on her lips as she bats her eyelashes.
Skaara: cocks a brow, that same mischevous grin right back on his lips as his hands wandered slowly, the fingertips of his left, finding their way up and down your backbone. The right, slowly undoing your pants.
Viktoria: shuddered and closed her eyes with a soft sigh, her spine arching gracefully to meet your teasing touch. As you loosened her pants, she shimmied out of them but snatched them up and slung them across the room somewhere.
Skaara: quickly returned to the kiss, letting his hands slide casually back to your hips.
Viktoria: captured your tongue twixt her lips and sucked on it playfully, her fingers tracing the muscles on your chest lazily.
Skaara: wiggled his tongue around yours, while his hands moved around and up, cupping both of your breasts.
Viktoria: moaned softly into the kiss as you cupped her still bra covered chest, but didn't bother to remove the obstruction, since you'd do it presently anyways. She did, however, wrap her legs around your waist, pulling you even closer.
Skaara: slides his left hand around your back, easily breaking free the clasp on your bra, his right hand tugs from the middle, pulling it from your body casually. He casts it asside, going back deeply into the kiss.
Skaara: slides his left hand around your back, easily breaking free the clasp on your bra, his right hand tugs from the middle, pulling it from your body casually. He casts it asside, going back deeply into the kiss.
Viktoria: giggles into the kiss and presses her chest to yours for a moment, rubbing her hard nipples against your flesh. She slips one lil thumb into the band on your boxers in the front.
Skaara: moved his hands back to cupping your breasts, this time, his head slid to the side, kissing his way softly along to your ear, where it rest, blowing softly.
Viktoria: shivered and giggled again, whispering in a soft, collected tone, "You are, without a doubt, the worst tease I know." She left her head fall to one side, enjoying the moment.
Skaara: opened his mouth and pulled your ear lobe into it, sucking lightly. a few seconds later, he exhaled lightly, "I know," his fingers now massaging your nipples.
Viktoria: rolled her shoulders back a bit, pressing her nipples into your fingers, resisting the urge to squeal as she did so. Her thumb tugged at your boxers gently, not to pull them off, but just to stretch the band some.
Skaara: slides his right down, easilly tugging free your panties from your hips. He slid them down as far as he could, while kissing his way down your neck.
Viktoria: unwrapped her legs long enough to kick her panties off, but didn't manage to catch them before they sank out of reach, only to surface in the center of the pool, "We'll have to remember to recollect all our things, dearest."
Skaara: coughed up a chuckle, and while the legs were unwrapped, managed to slides off his boxers, letting them join the other things variously tossed throughout the pool. "Or we could just let the guests find them?"
Viktoria: cocks an eyebrow and shakes her head slowly, "Oh I think not. The servants can gather them later when they clean the pool out. I have a feeling it's about to get a wee bit messy." She wrapped her legs around him tighter this time.
Skaara: leans his head down and licks your right nipple, his left hand once again massaging the other.
Viktoria: bites her lower lip and leans her head back against the edge the pool and squirms just a bit.
Skaara: slowly positioned himself just right between your legs, sliding the head right into you. His head lowered further, sucking your right nipple into his mouth, he rolled it around with his tongue for a few moments, then pressed it lightly against the 
Skaara: top line of his teeth*
Viktoria: gasped softly and gripped the edge of the pool with one hand, the other's nail dug gently into your shoulderblade. She took a few slow, deep breaths and sighed.
Skaara: slowly pulled back, then slid forward again, pushing in a little further. His attention switched from one nipple, to the other. His left hand, slid once more down your backbone, this time moving under you, to hold you up.
Skaara: slowly pulled back, then slid forward again, pushing in a little further. His attention switched from one nipple, to the other. His left hand, slid once more down your backbone, this time moving under you, to hold you up.
Viktoria: whimpered softly and whispered, "Tease" in a low, lusty tone. Her nipples perked up even more with each little caress and she shivered as the cool air of the room hit the one recently left.
Skaara: grinned and lightly bit down on your left nipple as he slid out to the head once again, this time pushing all the way in. his pace picked up a bit, and he began taking full strokes.
Viktoria: inhaled sharply in response to both the biting and the full penetration. She whimpered again and shut her eyes with a shudder. She was a pretty tight squeeze, tighter than one might imagine her to be.
Skaara: quickened his pace once again, now putting more force behind each thrust, grinning up from sucking on your left nipple, his eyes tried to look into yours.
Viktoria: lifts her head and rests her hands on your cheeks, stroking them gently as she moans, her eyes meeting yours, locked in an impassioned wanton gaze, her only words barely audible, "Been too long..."
Skaara: continues his current pace, rising up to kiss you passionately, running his tongue deep into your mouth with a sigh.
Viktoria: pressed her lips roughly to yours and gave your tongue a few good sucks, her own twirling around it with that delicious speed that only she was capable of.
Caleb: ahs. "Got it."
Skaara: lifts himself up out of the pool, spinning around, and flipping you with him. He laid back softly, pulling your head down with him, leaving you on top of him.
Viktoria: shudders as she slams down hard onto you, her eyes fluttering shut as she squeals in sheer bliss, "Jesus Christ...where did that come from?" She stares down at you wide-eyed.
Skaara: slides his hands down to your waist, and lifts you up as though you were weightless bouncing you up and down. The grin on his face widened seeing your expression. 
Caleb: nods, "Off to train then."
Viktoria: leans her head back and trembles, biting her lower lip as she bounces, eyes tight shut, a loud whimper escaping her pursed lips each time you force your way deep inside her.
Skaara: begins thrusting his hips up, applying force to the already forceful thrusts. his eyes closed tightly as a soft moan escaped his lips.
Viktoria: rolls her eyes to the back of her head and starts screaming your name, slowly at first, but louder and more often as your thrust become harder. Her hands are clenched tightly around your upper arms and her breasts bounce wildly each time you thrust
Skaara: bit his lip as all at once a wave of pleasure caused a violent shudder deep within his body, quickly he began to spill his seed deep inside you. Still the thrusts kept up, for several long moments.
Viktoria: leaned over you with a shrill squeal as she erupted in a mind-shattering orgasm, her walls spasming wildly out of control, fluids mixing with yours, flooding out and coating her thighs and yours, as well as the surrounding ground, "Jesus..."
Skaara: slowed the bouncing until it was safe to stop, gasping for breath as though the air had been sucked from the room. "Wow..."
Viktoria: basically collapsed atop you, panting, exhausted, sore, all at once. She lay her head on your chest and relaxed her eyes, silent, speechless, though her lips mouthed "Jesus" over and over again.
Skaara: wrapped his arms around your shoulders, his breath relaxed, his eyes closed.
Viktoria: slowed her breathing and rubbed her cheek affectionately against your chest before kissing it lightly, "Well...that wasn't too bad."
Skaara: running his fingers through your hair, "You're right... It has been too long."
Viktoria: rests calmly atop you and grins, "We should do that more often then. I'm game!" She giggles softly and lifts her head to kiss you softly, yet passionately.
Skaara: picks you up and runs off toward the bedroom.
Viktoria: hangs on for dear life?
Skaara: slips on some fresh clothes, and throws on his shoes and his trench coat.
Viktoria: pulls her wet hair up into a bun and pulls on some dry clothes, "Yeah, yeah, yeah..."
Skaara: picks you up again and carries you off to his ship.
Viktoria: can't stalk cookies and pouts.
Skaara: twirls his dual apoc's happily.

Seva: crumples to the ground
Ebon: yelps as Viktoria makes a feeble attempt at damaging the only reliable factor in his life, a once prized possession of his mother and his father. It'd served the three of them quite well, and he'd come to prize it just as highly as they had.

Aristel: squirms and sits up against the wall trying not to laugh

Viktoria: waits patiently.
Ebon: sat motionless, eyes closed, in his seat and simply muttered, "Forget about it."
Viktoria: searched the cabin for something to stare at, but found nothing, and so, fixed her eyes upon Ebon. She sank to the floor and studied him carefully, taking in his features silently.
Ebon: felt with his keen senses a seering focus coming at him. He lifted his left eyelid to see her staring at him. "Something the matter?" he asked as he sank back and closed his eyes once more.
Viktoria: glanced away quickly to avoid his prying eye, while shaking her head with vigor, "No, nothing at all..." Vikkie flicked a few pieces of debris from her boots in attemp to feign previous occupation.
Ebon: simply shrugged where he sat and sighed, "Nothing, indeed..." as he drifted off into a deep rest, though not sleep, his genetics making actual slumber quite hard on him.
Viktoria: watched him sink into the restful stint, then mustered up some courage. She'd no room for favor asking, but it was worth a shot, "Um...Ebon...can you help me with something...please?"
Ebon: opened his eyes suddenly, disturbed from his pseudo-sleep, a smidgeon of annoyance in his tone as he looked up at her and asked, "What is it? I'm trying to rest here."
Viktoria: shrank back a bit and swallowed hard, "Well, um...I was wondering if you could help me....see...I need to become mroe adept with my smuggling prowess...a good way to do that is to practice taking items....so um...I was wondering if you wouldn't min

Ebon: notices his arms wrapped around Viktoria and pulls them away quickly, "Umm, I'm sorry, I..." The night had been hectic, and he simply crashed upon the bed next to her.
Viktoria: gasps softly and pulls the covers up tightly around her, not daring to look at Ebon. "What...what happened here?" She stares straight up at the ceiling, eyes wide open in shock.
Ebon: panics and blurts out in a frenzy, "I have no idea, I just laid down because I was tired from the little thing the other night, and now this!" She pulled the covers away from him, now laying there with no cover.
Viktoria: closes her eyes for just a moment, trying to calm herself, "I..we...ok maybe nothing happened..." She glances over at him and catches a peek at his lack of clothing, then squeals and throws cover over him, "Jesus! Alright, maybe...something did hap
Viktoria: happen..."
Ebon: fumbles for words as he protests, "That can't be! I went to bed with most of my clothes on! What did you do to me!?" Not knowing what to do, he just stares at her, waiting for some kind of explanation.
Viktoria: gathers enough cover around her to keep herself warm. Ebon was rather toasty, she had to admit, "What did I do to you? What did you do to me!?!? I'm the innocent here!" She met his gaze with one equally as cold and confused.
Ebon: got loud as he argued, "I didn't do anything, innocent my ass!" Though waking up with a woman in his arms was quite a shock, he had rather enjoyed the feeling before he realized who it was he'd been cuddling with.
Viktoria: groaned and rolled over, her back to him, not wishing to argue the point, shivering now. She'd waken up in this bed alone for so long now, it was hard to readjust. "Well...either way...it was a long night...we weren't thinking clearly...so I guess 
Viktoria: *..."
Ebon: laid in shock as he mumbled, "This can't be happening, what an awful mistake..." It was about the last thing he'd expected to happen to him. What could possibly have happened that evening, that neither of them remembered? And how could he find out?
Viktoria: laughed softly and shook her head, "No, no, this is a dream, has to be." She rolled over on her back and let go of the covers, settling them over her bare waist, "You're not here and I'm really still quite asleep. Very funny, subconscious."
Ebon: was quite irritated to hear her joking so. This was not a laughing matter. With a grumble he reached for her soft bottom and pinched lightly, jeering, "Yes, subconscious. Very funny indeed."
Viktoria: squealed as he pinched her and rubbed her sore rear, then squealed again and yanked the covers back up, "OhmiGod...I just showed him my tits..." she thought to herself. "Ok so maybe that didn't work...I...I don't know..."
Ebon: groaned as he lay back. "What a nightmare..." Thinking hard about it, he began to relax. "I suppose it's not that terrible. I certainly could've picked a worse woman to accidentally make love to." He glanced over at her... He could have, indeed.
Viktoria: reddened considerably and covered her face, more to hide the smile that was cracking than her embarrassment. However he'd meant the comment, it was taken rather lightly. "Yeah I guess it must not have been that bad?" Did she just say that?
Ebon: grinned. "That's a funny thing for you to say, last I was aware you couldn't stand me." He took her all in... Her lithe figure, her supple breasts, her firm, round ass, and the adorable, embarassed smile on her face. Truly a sight to behold.
Viktoria: rolled to her side and looked at him, oblivious of the visual scan, "I can stand you...I mean I can deal with you, as in you're not bothersome, I like you alright, I don't mean I'm in love with you or anything, but like I mean I don't hate you or..
Ebon: looked at her confusedly. "Who said anything about being in love?" Though not quite in love with her attitude, he was very much in love with her body, and had calmed down considerably since he'd awoke. Thoughts flooded into his head about how he'd 
Ebon: (c) love to hold her again, but he resisted these urges.
Viktoria: sighed softly and rolled away from him again, letting the covers rest over her curvaceous hips, but rolling forward such that none of her chest could be seen, save a peek here and there, "I didn't mean it like that...always so angry..."
Ebon: rolled over as well, his back now facing hers, as he uttered, "I honestly don't try to be..." It was true. He couldn't seem to help himself, always in a rage. He'd quite lost his cool the evening before -- Adrenaline did foul things to him.
Viktoria: returned to a prone position and spoke softer now with less edge. She'd calmed down as well and, somewhere within her, wanted to feel his soothing embrace again. "Really? Well I guess I don't help that much, do I..."
Ebon: shrugged and sighed as he said, "You can hardly be expected to be responsible for my behavior, I was taught better than that..." He stopped there. He'd not seen or heard from his family in the longest, and it tore at him, and he fell silent.
Viktoria: studied him carefully and took his features in. He wasn't hard on the eyes at all. "You were only doing what you felt needed to be done...to protect m...ESUN's interests. I was only getting in the way."
Ebon: grumbled. "Poor excuse to show a complete lack of civility to a lady." He'd been brought up almost as if royalty, despite the fact his was a family of killers. "I shouldn't have shown my frustration like that, and I apologize." He still lay looking
Ebon: (c) away from her, feeling very lonely, especially seeing he was lying next to a naked woman, and a warm one at that.
Viktoria: nodded slowly and bit her lip, her hand inches away from his shoulder. She could sense some unrest in him, but she dared not comfort him, for fear of retribution. Until the nerve came, words would have to suffice, "Hey, it's alright...I understand.
Ebon: sighed and turned back to face her. As he raised his gaze up to her face, he stared right into her eyes, and everything else became a blur. What in the world was happening? This woman he could bearly tolerate on a previous evening was driving him w
Ebon: (c) wild with passion. What was going on?
Viktoria: returned the gaze, speechless for now. She could feel her cheeks reddening, but she was powerless to break the moment. With his change in position and her hand still poised, it now rested on his chest. <c>
Viktoria: She lay there, captivated, knowing what she wanted, but not what she should do.
Ebon: stepped out of his comatose state and made his move. Wrapping his left arm around her body, he leaned in, his lips meeting hers, locking her lips into a passionate kiss. Her hand still on his chest, it sunk into her bosom as he pressed against her.
Viktoria: gasped softly and simply melted, her body almost limp against his. The initial shock sent a shiver through her body, and she pressed herself more fully into him now as their lips mingled and got acquainted. She could definitely get used to this.
Ebon: snaked his tongue between her lips, reaching in to play a happy game of tag with hers. He held her more tightly now, slipping his hand in between him and her, bringing it to rest upon her right breast. He cupped it gently as he sunk his fingers lig
Ebon: (c) lightly into the soft, squishy flesh.
Viktoria: welcomed his tongue warmly, her own spiraling and twirling around it evasively. She'd never imagined being this intimate with Ebon, but now it seemed so natural. She'd never known him to be so forward, but the attention was becoming an addiction.
Ebon: continued to hold onto her lovingly, pressing her body ever closer to his, taking in her warmth. The covers, however, had quite gotten in the way, and so he pulled the covers from them, bringing her body to rest on top, and covered the two of them 
Ebon: (c) once more, all the while never breaking their impassioned kiss.
Viktoria: loved the way his strong frame cradled her delicate figure, her curves melding to him, breasts flattened against his chest. She giggled softly and relaxed now, the wave of tension that loomed over them broken by a simple, steamy kiss which had yet 
Viktoria: (c) to be.
Ebon: reached over her body now and grabbed a hold roughly, though not harshly, grasping onto her warmly and lovingly as he lowered himself to her neck, tonguing and kissing there briskly, lost in the passion that surfaced as he dove into the darkness of
Ebon: (c) her eyes.
Viktoria: leaned her head back, exposing more of her neck for the rending. He knew exactly know to work her buttons and he did with with expertise. How did he keep this side of himself pinned up so well? This passion and lust...it was intoxicating to say in 
Viktoria: (c) the least. Vikkie closed her eyes and enjoyed the moment, exhaling deeply.
Ebon: pulled her head back down to him, reaching up to her ear and running the tip of his tongue along it gently, blowing softly into her ear to entice her. His hands grasped both of her full breasts now, massaging them lightly, pressing on them occasion
Ebon: (c) occasionally. He'd never imagined himself in a position like this.
Viktoria: gasped and shivered as his moist tongue met her sensitive little ear, followed by the cool breeze of his breath. her breathing slowed as she relaxed further and grew a bit bolder, "Ebon...did you...have you wante...when did you fi..." She was no go
Viktoria: (c) good with the words and just let it go.

Viktoria: rolled over and tugged the covers up more, gathering them around her shivering person but not uncovering Ebon. She was quite sound asleep in a far away place, unaware and unbedight.
Viktoria: yawned as she sat up in bed, stretching and rubbing the sleep from her eyes. She turned to her side and glanced at Ebon with a sweet smile, then leaned over to place a gentle kiss on his forehead.
Viktoria: scooted over and rested her chin on his chest, her eyes wide as saucers, lower lip quivering pitifully. A soft whimper was effortlessly eminating from her pouty pursed lips, "It'll be fun..." Her fingertips danced across his left ear as she pleaded
Ebon: rolls over and snores.
Viktoria: sighed softly, "Maybe last night was just a fluke..." She slid out of bed careful not to wake Ebon, and made her way to the door, sneaking out of it and shutting it behind her quietly. Vikkie shrugged and strolled down the hall to the pool, complet
Viktoria: completely naked.
Viktoria: surfaced with an elegant pose, slicking her hair back against her neck. Her eyes fell on Ebon and she half smiled, a little unsure of where they stood, "I thought you wanted to sleep?"
Viktoria: <c> Vikkie watched him for a moment then motioned the pool attendant and ordered a strawberry daiquiri for herself.
Ebon: shrugged and sunk into the pool. "I was just giving you a hard time," he mumbled, shoulder's depth in the water. He looked up at Vik's naked body as the water dripped from it in awe. Her lucious image was even more enticing damp.
Viktoria: swims over to the side of pool, resting next to Ebon, her elbows propped back on the ledge, and her feet resting on the side, thus forcing her back to arch and her perky breasts with their hardened nipples to command a bit more attention, "So mean.

Ebon: grinned and said, "You love it." Her breasts commanded more attention indeed, the wet mounds of flesh laying back against her ribs, water trickling in tiny streams down their sides. He thought to reach over to dry them off (For the most part), but 
Ebon: decided against it and simply stared.
Viktoria: took the daiquiri that was brought to her and sipped it, then sat it aside and watched his eyes, trying to place his gaze, "If you stare any harder, they will develop a complex?"
Viktoria: <c> Her cheeks were burning now and she rolled over on her stomach, effectively hiding her breasts and her red face.
Ebon: grinned as she turned herself away, her cheeks a rosy red now from embarassment. He aimed his gaze now at the round, full ass that was sitting just on top of the water. He reached over and gave it a good slap, sneering, "I seen it all anyway?"
Viktoria: gasped softly and laughed, then sprung off the wall and up out of the water, at the same time using her momentum to force Ebon under. She snickered and rubbed her sore rear with a little pout, "Bitch...."
Ebon: emerged from under the water, coughing and sputtering, catching his breath as he shouts, "You'll pay for that!" He leapt out of the water and chased after her, finally pinning her down on a pool chair, before licking her playfully, chuckling.
Viktoria: squirmed weakly under his firm hold, feigning distress, "Oh no! Not the licking! I'll do anything!" She squealed and laughed as his rough tongue met her wet lithe body.
Ebon: laughed, "You'll do anything, now, will you?" With this, he reached down towards her crotch, slipping his hand between her thighs and stroking the soft pink there, pressing into her clit softly as he continues to run his tongue along the side of he

Neko: got word from Sirius that the rule wasn't lifted.
Fred: so i see
Fred: this sucks
Fred: tell sirius to come here?
Fred: he told me to tell him once i read the notes
Sirius: Fred, the thing is...if you were a first time offender...or a 100th time offender, even...it could be concieved that you could get off the hook.
Neko: says 'Sirius isn't online.'
Sirius: But...you're not. 
Neko: says, 'Or so he is...'
Sirius: If you -did- think that you could bypass other rules somehow, because another one was lifted, you should have asked.
Fred: yea so now i must wait?
Sirius: No no no no.
Fred: i did
Sirius: I don't want you to wait.
Sirius: I want you to read the rules
Sirius: And not cheat
Fred: i read the rules
Sirius: I bet you did. But now, you have to not cheat.
Fred: ask neko if i asked her as soon as i logged on
Sirius: And I BET you can't do that.
Sirius: You've done it every single time you get a character.
Sirius: Now, Fred, I want you to play. Don't think I want to discourage you from playing.
Sirius: But you see, there are rules for a reason.
Sirius: And you don't understand the reason
Sirius: Or you think that there's a reason that you can bypass them
Sirius: And that's not fair. You're not above anyone
Fred: true
Sirius: Well, of course it's true, you silly goose :)
Fred: but please, neko tell him i asked
Sirius: Asked what? None of that's going to make a difference.
Fred: An Immortal If you -did- think that you could bypass other rules somehow, because another one was lifted, you should have ask
Fred: i did ask
Fred: im just telling you that
Neko: I wish Immortals who lift rules would either remove them from the list, or make a new Help File referring to what rules were removed.
Sirius: Well, there was a discussion about that.
Sirius: About not reading articles
Neko: As-is, Gil gets an attitude with me every time he logs in just because I exist as an Immortal. The rules didn't help any today.
Sirius: And you see why there was a decrease of players.
Fred: yes
Neko: I've been in plenty of MUDs that Immortals weren't thorough in anything, so when one rule was removed, two or three others went with it.
Neko: So.... That's what I'm typically used to.
Neko: shrug
Fred: sirius can tank get his things back?
Sirius: Fred
Sirius: You have half a mind to ask for anything back. I should take YOUR shit
Sirius: You see...I'm not stupid
Sirius: I mstated both Fred and Tank
Sirius: ONE PLAYER had money
Sirius: Amazingly, the next day, SKAARA DIDNT LOG ON, PLEASE DONT LIE, both players had money
Sirius: More amazingly, one player lost the equivalent of what one player gained.
Sirius: Any ideas how that happened?
Fred: ok
Sirius: Yah. 
Sirius: See what happens when you lie to Hal and I?
Sirius: We're intelligent. We're not degenerates. 
Fred: just delete tank
Sirius: I can't :P
Sirius: I have no will to do so.
Sirius: I want you to play here
Fred: ok then
Sirius: But I don't want you to cheat.
Sirius: There just doesn't seem to be a way around that.
Fred: im not pointing fingers but mortals that have imms need not use the imms for their use
Sirius: Well, it's no lie that Hal has grudges, and uses Mennis to do w/e
Sirius: He'll be the first to admit it.
Fred: yes
Fred: let me get one thing straight here
Fred: i am allowed to use triggers as long as i am watching the screen right?

Fred: yea you were probably bestowed them
Fred: o well

Neko: Not really.
Fred: lol
Neko: I'm trying to put something else up right now, it's taking up most of my time.
