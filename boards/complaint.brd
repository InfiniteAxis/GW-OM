To All Players:

  This board is for COMPLAINTS ONLY! Which means that if there is a concern
that you must bring up with an imm and there is no immortal present, post
your concern here and we will deal with it accordingly.
 
  This means that if there is something about an unfair kill that was not
seen, or there are other issues that we cannot be present to referee,
please contact one of us here. Most likely, it will be myself (Hana) who
will be dealing with your concerns.
 
 
Thanks.
- Hana
