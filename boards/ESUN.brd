combat squadron for the clan.  If you wish to become a pilot go through
me.  In my absance go through Scias. If neither of us are here, well tough
luck.  Wait for one of us.

ALWAYS make sure there is a guard from the landing pad up to the first
intersection. If there isn't, please use the "post guard" skill to call
one out. But remember, only one per room. If you aren't level 1000 lead,
ask someone who is to do it.
